<start> tom thinks he can trust mary . <end>
<start> the boy adjusted his cap . <end>

<start> the fastest team wins . <end>
<start> in october , the leaves begin to fall . <end>
<start> that was a close call . <end>
<start> what did you do then ? <end>
<start> he doesn t want to wait for you . <end>
<start> it s possible , but not probable . <end>
<start> i think we should hire tom instead of mary . <end>
<start> we depend on you . <end>
<start> the party lasted more than three hours . <end>

<start> you know who he is . <end>
<start> he is not as smart as his older brother . <end>
<start> what is one food that you could never give up ? <end>
<start> it took me nearly two hours to write the essay . <end>
<start> i repeated what he said exactly as he had said it . <end>
<start> he has been to hokkaido . <end>
<start> it s too soon . <end>
<start> tom is too young . <end>
<start> the team is up for the game . <end>
<start> better to err on the side of caution . <end>
<start> tom painted the fence . <end>
<start> i sell umbrellas . <end>
<start> we failed to persuade him . <end>
<start> tom couldn t rule out the possibility that mary didn t like him . <end>
<start> i entered the room and shook hands with him . <end>
<start> it is difficult for me to answer the question . <end>
<start> i wanted you to like me . <end>
<start> why don t you try on this yellow sweater ? <end>
<start> are you busy now ? <end>
<start> i m going to tell you something . <end>

<start> headlines are supposed to grab the reader s interest . <end>
<start> i want you to relax . <end>
<start> i am eating a doughnut . <end>
<start> do you think tom will like it ? <end>
<start> i only told tom what mary told me . <end>
<start> these boots are expensive . <end>
<start> he s stronger than me . <end>
<start> i found a bird whose wing was severely damaged . <end>
<start> i knew you d find tom . <end>

<start> tom gave mary the benefit of the doubt . <end>
<start> he s not in . <end>
<start> tom and mary were my backup singers back when i used to perform . <end>
<start> our efforts will soon bear fruit . <end>
<start> they were extremely excited . <end>
<start> tom doesn t fear death . <end>

<start> tom is really upset . <end>
<start> she makes excellent meals in the blink of an eye . <end>
<start> we were all present at her wedding . <end>
<start> nobody died . <end>
<start> the surgeon operated on the patient . <end>
<start> i like my coffee without sugar . <end>
<start> the rain lasted five days . <end>
<start> my fingers left marks on the glass . <end>
<start> i waited three hours . <end>
<start> tom couldn t believe that mary had tricked him . <end>
<start> they know you . <end>

<start> do you think i still love her ? <end>
<start> give me the keys . <end>
<start> tom told mary everything . <end>

<start> i d like to visit australia . <end>
<start> tom doesn t like to be disturbed . <end>
<start> i usually take a shower before breakfast . <end>
<start> tom only eats lean meats and vegetables . <end>
<start> they won t understand . <end>
<start> democrats and republicans worked together . <end>
<start> tom tried to talk mary into driving all night . <end>
<start> the news filled her with sorrow . <end>
<start> we just want to talk . <end>
<start> he promised not to be late again . <end>
<start> i knew i should ve married you . <end>
<start> tom is a creature of habit . <end>
<start> tom probably knew who i was . <end>
<start> when you are hungry , anything tastes good . <end>
<start> that won t happen . <end>
<start> even tom is surprised that mary lied . <end>
<start> i hope this is worth it . <end>
<start> i will definitely go to your funeral . <end>
<start> i don t want to disappoint my parents . <end>

<start> here is my key . <end>
<start> did tom come home ? <end>
<start> try hard . <end>
<start> that s because you re a girl . <end>
<start> i m from tokyo , japan . <end>
<start> friendship requires mutual trust . <end>
<start> i feel as if i ve woken up from a nightmare . <end>
<start> tom explained the reasons for his decision . <end>
<start> tom is very incompetent . <end>
<start> it seems that the children will have to sleep on the floor . <end>
<start> bad news travels fast . <end>
<start> tom called her again . <end>
<start> tom held a gun to mary s head . <end>
<start> how about wearing contact lenses ? <end>
<start> we need evidence . <end>
<start> my mom is overprotective . <end>
<start> have you met tom yet ? <end>
<start> none of this was your fault . <end>
<start> i hope that she ll get better soon . <end>
<start> have you ever heard of such a thing ? <end>

<start> when you come across new words , you must look them up in your dictionary . <end>
<start> she doesn t live near the office . <end>

<start> tom doesn t like the way mary treats her dog . <end>

<start> it s hard to surprise tom . <end>
<start> she went that way . <end>

<start> i decided to continue doing that . <end>
<start> tom knows how to run a club . <end>
<start> she tore the letter into pieces . <end>

<start> he is skating . <end>
<start> i m staying in italy . <end>
<start> she has seven sons . <end>
<start> he doesn t have as many books as she does . <end>
<start> tom managed to tell me the truth . <end>

<start> the professor encouraged me in my studies . <end>
<start> don t eat too much . <end>
<start> we appreciate his talent . <end>
<start> tom was scared . <end>
<start> tom wasn t happy with what he saw . <end>
<start> just because he likes painting doesn t mean he s good at it . <end>
<start> close the window . <end>
<start> it s really tough . <end>
<start> you must be careful not to make him angry . <end>
<start> she stood up to answer the phone . <end>
<start> tom and mary s house is very untidy . <end>
<start> children like playing more than studying . <end>
<start> she had to study hard to catch up with her classmates . <end>
<start> you re germans , aren t you ? <end>
<start> they had fun with us . <end>
<start> i m sure that ll really be appreciated . <end>
<start> he denied that he had accepted the bribe . <end>

<start> i want a volunteer to help me . <end>
<start> he is in pajamas . <end>

<start> is tom done ? <end>
<start> he felt uneasy in his father s presence . <end>
<start> it s almost      . <end>
<start> find tom . <end>
<start> tom seldom speaks to me anymore . <end>
<start> i am accustomed to cold weather . <end>
<start> which dog is yours ? <end>
<start> tom jumped out of his bedroom window . <end>
<start> tom eats nothing but fruits and vegetables . <end>
<start> tom made it quite clear what he didn t want us to do . <end>
<start> old people are usually very wise . <end>
<start> i ve got a friend who works for the new york times . <end>
<start> you ll thank me . <end>
<start> don t get on the train yet . <end>
<start> we must have something to live for . <end>

<start> tom was happy to see mary . <end>
<start> thank you for all you ve done . <end>
<start> tom and mary got divorced last year . <end>
<start> tom is useless . <end>
<start> what we need now is action , not discussion . <end>
<start> would you eat the last cookie on the plate if other people were watching ? <end>
<start> tom might go with you . <end>
<start> was he really boring ? <end>
<start> you can get in touch with me tomorrow . <end>
<start> she was a bridesmaid at the wedding . <end>
<start> what do you want to do before you die ? <end>
<start> this is good coffee . <end>
<start> was he really boring ? <end>
<start> let me think for a minute . <end>
<start> tom needs to know the truth . <end>
<start> he got tired of the work , and left it half done . <end>
<start> he carried a bundle of clothes . <end>
<start> can i have some ? <end>
<start> tom is miserly . <end>
<start> are you really not mad at me ? <end>
<start> the dirty plates in the restaurant disgusted us . <end>
<start> remain seated , please . <end>
<start> can you take notes for me during the professor s talk ? <end>
<start> some words have double meanings . <end>
<start> doctors save lives . <end>

<start> my doctor told me to quit smoking . <end>
<start> can i use your car ? sure . go ahead . <end>
<start> which movie did you watch today ? <end>
<start> we like him . <end>
<start> at times , he suffered from a painful headache . <end>
<start> tom doesn t believe anything mary says . <end>
<start> as soon as the ship began to move , he got seasick . <end>
<start> i ll never stop loving you . <end>
<start> thanks for warning me . <end>
<start> this is really cool . <end>
<start> i think he needs to alter his lifestyle . <end>
<start> i was told to get enough sleep . <end>
<start> the allotment is inadequate . <end>
<start> i have lost the key . <end>
<start> can you still remember the time we first met ? <end>
<start> the teacher omitted the exercise on page    of the book . <end>
<start> let s talk about why you re here . <end>
<start> don t give me such a sad look . <end>
<start> no one voted against it . <end>
<start> i ve never seen you laugh . <end>
<start> a wink was his only answer . <end>
<start> perhaps she will come tomorrow . <end>
<start> stop putting off finding a job . <end>
<start> i just got back from school . <end>
<start> i want some food . <end>
<start> we have known each other since we were children . <end>

<start> tom suggested that i write mary a letter . <end>
<start> i d rather be a bird than a fish . <end>
<start> my dog and my cat get along fine . <end>
<start> tom cut his hand when he fell . <end>
<start> tom gave mary his telephone number . <end>

<start> i ll be at home all day tomorrow . <end>
<start> do you have an alarm clock in your room ? <end>
<start> i have never climbed mt . fuji . <end>
<start> tom left right away . <end>
<start> it s very difficult to understand her . <end>
<start> they re going to blame tom for this . <end>
<start> i smiled . <end>
<start> you need to open an account at a bank to receive the payment . <end>
<start> i must get this work finished by next tuesday . <end>
<start> you re great . <end>
<start> love is stronger than death . <end>
<start> the rich sometimes despise the poor . <end>
<start> it is no use trying to escape . <end>
<start> there is no money in my bag . <end>
<start> is everybody ready for the trip ? <end>
<start> i can t see anything because the whole place is dark . <end>

<start> i just want to know what you did this morning . <end>

<start> all the skill of the sailors gave way to the violence of the storm . <end>
<start> do you want to be an actor in a movie ? <end>
<start> i didn t do my homework . <end>
<start> keep still . <end>
<start> he begged me to stay . <end>
<start> it happened that her husband was a dentist . <end>
<start> i ll tell you only if you promise to keep it to yourself . <end>
<start> if i can t trust myself , who can i trust ? <end>
<start> we should be very careful . <end>
<start> tom has a cousin who is a doctor . <end>
<start> i hope to get away from tokyo for a few days . <end>
<start> we re getting out of here . the cops are coming . <end>
<start> i ll give you a prescription . <end>
<start> you are not going to die here . <end>
<start> she has some beautiful antique furniture . <end>
<start> do you want to sit somewhere else ? <end>
<start> could you turn down the volume ? <end>
<start> tom s the only one who could ve done this . <end>
<start> tom has written hundreds of songs . <end>
<start> tom put his phone in his pocket . <end>

<start> winter is coming soon . <end>
<start> i don t watch tv . <end>
<start> i don t envy her . <end>
<start> call the police ! <end>
<start> such a ridiculous superstition no longer exists . <end>
<start> women don t drive as well as men . <end>
<start> these are new . <end>
<start> don t do that anymore . <end>
<start> they sound so similar it s not easy to distinguish them . <end>
<start> tom is faster than you think . <end>
<start> tom rewound the tape . <end>
<start> school bores me . <end>
<start> some students looked at her with tears in their eyes . <end>
<start> don t leave the fire unattended . <end>
<start> i don t like the way she laughs . <end>
<start> i think it s kind of stupid . <end>
<start> don t let go of the rope till i tell you . <end>
<start> i can get you one if you like . <end>
<start> tom apologized for not doing what he had promised he d do . <end>
<start> they kissed . <end>
<start> i want to know what i can do . <end>
<start> get away from here . <end>
<start> does he need to go right now ? <end>
<start> she traveled around the world . <end>
<start> i m a little tired . <end>
<start> a man who wanted to see you came while you were out . <end>
<start> i want to be alone ! <end>
<start> wake them up . <end>
<start> last sunday i relaxed at home . <end>
<start> tom spent christmas in boston with mary . <end>
<start> do you like music ? <end>
<start> many students go to europe for the purpose of studying music . <end>
<start> i would like to give him a present for his birthday . <end>
<start> you are free to say what you think . <end>
<start> what are you thinking of ? <end>
<start> have you made a decision ? <end>
<start> do you like black cats ? <end>
<start> falling on ice hurts . <end>
<start> have you missed me ? <end>
<start> i have to take a shower . <end>
<start> this fire has just gone out . <end>
<start> there s a lot of trash on the far bank of the river . <end>
<start> he has eyes at the back of his head . <end>
<start> please hurry up . <end>
<start> we re out of sugar . <end>
<start> the teacher warned us that the test would be hard . <end>
<start> mary s not pretty , but she isn t ugly , either . <end>
<start> tom found a dead body on the beach . <end>
<start> i m still worried . <end>
<start> can i buy only the lenses ? <end>
<start> i don t like any of these hats . <end>
<start> where exactly did you come from ? <end>
<start> she s loved by her friends . <end>
<start> can we do it before monday ? <end>
<start> i talked to friends . <end>
<start> i didn t tell anyone . <end>
<start> that s nice . <end>
<start> leave now . <end>
<start> tom wanted to see me right away . <end>
<start> this was not the only problem . <end>
<start> how about a drink ? <end>
<start> you re invited . <end>
<start> tom cares . <end>
<start> i never did figure it out . <end>
<start> suddenly , it started to rain . <end>
<start> he is as poor as can be . <end>
<start> the party in power is corrupt , but the opposition is little better . <end>
<start> let s sing another song . <end>
<start> i lost no time in visiting my aunt in the hospital yesterday . <end>
<start> let s leave things as they are until he comes back . <end>
<start> she has faults , but i love her none the less . <end>
<start> how can i find tom ? <end>
<start> let s see if tom is in his office . <end>
<start> everyone hates me . <end>
<start> he s looking at you . <end>
<start> hold your breath . <end>
<start> the news that the school had been burned down soon spread though the town . <end>
<start> whose pictures are those ? <end>
<start> tom is still working here , isn t he ? <end>
<start> tom may be hurt . <end>
<start> my motorcycle is new . <end>
<start> we want to go to boston and chicago . <end>
<start> it was just an experiment . <end>
<start> whatever happens , you must keep calm . <end>
<start> the air felt a little cold . <end>
<start> she didn t like her husband . <end>
<start> i eat only when i m hungry . <end>
<start> many senators opposed it . <end>
<start> there is a traffic jam on the highway . <end>
<start> it s true that he is in love with her . <end>
<start> why didn t anyone warn me ? <end>
<start> you ll feel better . <end>
<start> first i ll look at the prices , and only then i ll decide whether i ll buy the camera or not . <end>
<start> i want to go back to my friends . <end>
<start> tom is a writer . <end>
<start> tom seemed lost . <end>
<start> it might be good if you bought it . <end>
<start> the neck of the bottle was broken . <end>
<start> in case of emergency , call     . <end>
<start> against the snow , the white rabbit was invisible . <end>
<start> i knew tom would ask that . <end>
<start> even the richest man cannot buy everything . <end>
<start> i gave some water to the dogs . <end>
<start> tom is my only real friend . <end>
<start> the mayor of this city was blamed for turning a deaf ear to the people s requests . <end>
<start> do you like living here ? <end>
<start> i ll make you happy . <end>
<start> how long have you been in boston ? <end>
<start> he saw a butterfly on the wall . <end>
<start> tom brought this . <end>
<start> they defended their country . <end>
<start> i ve been trying to lose a little weight . <end>
<start> i saved your life . <end>
<start> i think tom doesn t have a dog . <end>
<start> tom went back to work . <end>
<start> i think it s time for me to clean the garage . <end>
<start> tom forgot to lock the front door . <end>
<start> can i leave now ? <end>
<start> he ll never forgive me . <end>
<start> tom is good at singing . <end>
<start> i do not know whether to take it as a compliment or an insult . <end>
<start> i m sorry to have caused you so much trouble . <end>
<start> this room looks like a pigsty . <end>
<start> bring me the newspaper . <end>
<start> tom shouted for help . <end>
<start> i work every day except saturday . <end>
<start> could you call me back a bit later ? <end>
<start> tom ate something . <end>
<start> when i was young , i would often go to watch baseball games . <end>
<start> i ate dinner last night , but i don t think tom did . <end>
<start> tom had white shoes on . <end>
<start> just leave it there . <end>
<start> you go first . <end>
<start> tom likes the idea as well . <end>
<start> how many kids does tom have ? <end>
<start> that s an incredible story . <end>
<start> it looks like an apple . <end>
<start> he can make himself understood in english . <end>
<start> i hope we ll never have to do that again . <end>
<start> i have to hurry ! <end>
<start> please make sure that the door is locked . <end>
<start> i m eating a pear . <end>
<start> stop patronizing me . <end>
<start> tom spit out the poison . <end>
<start> stay here with us . <end>
<start> it s the biggest building in the city . <end>
<start> i kind of liked tom . <end>
<start> did you do your homework by yourself ? <end>
<start> i would like to have this car repaired as soon as possible . <end>
<start> tom slipped . <end>
<start> they re defenseless . <end>
<start> he had few other friends . <end>
<start> i used to smoke a lot , but i have given up smoking now . <end>
<start> tom stared at mary . <end>
<start> tom plays the bass guitar in our band . <end>
<start> i have known him for ten years . <end>
<start> he brought his dog to school . <end>
<start> could you make room for me ? <end>
<start> i guess i needed someone to blame . <end>
<start> i need a good dictionary . <end>
<start> you didn t let me answer . <end>
<start> the patient s condition changes every day . <end>
<start> i don t need you to take care of me . <end>
<start> his poor dog is still alive . <end>
<start> he wanted to teach english at school . <end>
<start> yesterday i had a high fever . <end>
<start> she kissed him . <end>
<start> i agree to his plan . <end>
<start> let s go sit in the shade . <end>
<start> could you let me see your notes ? <end>
<start> it would be virtually impossible to convince tom to come along with us . <end>
<start> i am driving a truck . <end>
<start> that plan s bound to fail . <end>
<start> somehow , he weaseled himself out of jury duty . <end>
<start> do your homework by yourself . <end>
<start> some boats are on the lake . <end>
<start> this is carcinogenic . <end>
<start> is she satisfied ? <end>

<start> she went there by herself . <end>
<start> she substituted margarine for butter . <end>
<start> such an idea is abhorrent to her . <end>
<start> there were no laws saying what they could or could not do . <end>
<start> it s difficult to reconcile all the opinions . <end>
<start> you made the same mistake . <end>
<start> she called him back to give him something he had left behind . <end>
<start> i think you need to find yourself a part time job . <end>
<start> we tried to trap the fox . <end>

<start> her grandmother lived to be eighty eight years old . <end>

<start> a number of traffic accidents have happened recently . <end>
<start> whatever happens , i want you to know that i love you . <end>
<start> he planned the attack carefully . <end>

<start> it s morning here in my time zone . <end>
<start> don t eat between meals . <end>
<start> do you like trips ? <end>
<start> can the report be true ? <end>
<start> she lost her temper with me . <end>
<start> you might have heard of me . <end>
<start> he disappeared without a trace . <end>
<start> she has a bad reputation . <end>
<start> that s mine . <end>

<start> tom corrected himself . <end>
<start> tom came by car . <end>
<start> tom wishes he had a bigger car . <end>
<start> i raised my hand to ask a question . <end>
<start> what causes it ? <end>
<start> tom didn t bring the matter up at the meeting this morning . <end>
<start> we know you re busy . <end>

<start> tom has no respect for authority . <end>
<start> he achieved his goal . <end>
<start> she has lost all hope . <end>
<start> don t hesitate to ask questions if you don t understand . <end>
<start> people ought to work . <end>
<start> he will arrive in kyoto tomorrow . <end>

<start> cottage cheese is my favorite food . <end>
<start> tom is married to mary now , but at one time he was married to alice . <end>

<start> tom didn t want to marry the farmer s daughter . <end>
<start> my parents made me go there . <end>
<start> tom never says hello . <end>
<start> she ll be getting married next year . <end>
<start> tom opened his mouth to interrupt . <end>
<start> get tom away from me . <end>
<start> generally speaking , women live longer than men . <end>
<start> they come from the same country . <end>
<start> it is better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes . <end>
<start> my mother has four brothers . <end>
<start> how did tom do this ? <end>
<start> we ll begin shortly . <end>
<start> the wedding will take place at the end of october . <end>
<start> tom got these tickets for nothing . <end>
<start> i take a shower almost every day . <end>

<start> i would like to see my father . <end>
<start> you lucky devil ! <end>
<start> we should get more organized . <end>
<start> i have three pieces of baggage . <end>
<start> tom is realistic . <end>
<start> tom says he feels fine . <end>
<start> do you want to do this ? <end>
<start> tom ate breakfast all by himself . <end>
<start> tom came by car . <end>
<start> he began to be a problem . <end>
<start> tom said that he felt sorry for mary . <end>
<start> it seems like a dream . <end>
<start> the dog barked at the mailman . <end>
<start> after supper , i always find myself falling asleep . <end>
<start> do you know where the police station is ? <end>
<start> in addition to being a famous physicist , he is a great novelist . <end>
<start> this is the coldest winter that we have had in thirty years . <end>
<start> i hope that you will continue to favor us with your support . <end>
<start> tom wondered what mary was doing here . <end>
<start> i went swimming in the sea . <end>
<start> how did you come to know one another ? <end>
<start> tom s a bright boy . <end>
<start> he shouted , get out ! <end>
<start> i couldn t speak french . <end>
<start> do you know the lyrics to this song ? <end>
<start> tom said that he needed a change . <end>
<start> i met tom on the way . <end>
<start> you have to respect your elders . <end>
<start> i don t have money . <end>
<start> tom seemed genuinely surprised when i told him that mary had left town . <end>
<start> we sat down on a bench to talk . <end>
<start> money is useless on a desert island . <end>
<start> tom finally got a job . <end>
<start> more than   ,     people were at the concert . <end>
<start> these pearls look real . <end>
<start> she is an appalling cook . <end>
<start> did you find your contact lenses ? <end>
<start> from now on , we ll do it this way . <end>
<start> tom really wants to improve . <end>
<start> his answer was far from satisfactory . <end>
<start> the trip will take at least five days . <end>
<start> she didn t want him to die . <end>
<start> the new bridge is under construction . <end>
<start> the workmen didn t go down into the mine that night . <end>
<start> it s easy money . <end>
<start> why are you so interested in what tom was doing ? <end>
<start> do you want to have sushi tonight ? <end>
<start> i go to hiroshima three times a month . <end>
<start> i have eaten nothing for the past three days . <end>
<start> i ll do my homework after i watch television . <end>
<start> although he is very old , he is strong . <end>
<start> the doctor told me that i should eat breakfast every day . <end>
<start> many politicians fail to keep their promises . <end>
<start> she s also a beauty . <end>
<start> i ve never had chinese food . <end>
<start> sometimes he acted as if he were my boss . <end>
<start> i d like a word with you . <end>
<start> you might be right . <end>
<start> the crew is busy preparing for the voyage into outer space . <end>
<start> these men are strong . <end>
<start> do you love me ? <end>
<start> barack obama is the president of the united states . <end>
<start> it s improved . <end>
<start> he can write with either hand . <end>
<start> nobody wants to help you . <end>
<start> it is on this point that our opinions differ . <end>
<start> you need to slow down . <end>
<start> just follow your heart . <end>
<start> nobody knows where tom went . <end>
<start> it took them some time to get used to one another . <end>
<start> i would have been happier if i had stayed there . <end>
<start> who gave you permission to do this ? <end>
<start> this book is much more useful than that one . <end>
<start> i love golf . <end>
<start> he still remembers you . <end>
<start> i ll never let that happen again . <end>
<start> i work with him . <end>
<start> tom is a very patient man . <end>
<start> i reprimanded him for his insolence . <end>
<start> at first i didn t like it . <end>
<start> since you did the cooking , i ll do the dishes . <end>
<start> love doesn t guarantee a successful marriage . <end>
<start> you re very wise , tom . <end>
<start> the coffee was so hot that i nearly burned my tongue . <end>
<start> the leaves have all fallen . <end>
<start> they drank two bottles of wine . <end>
<start> he will be writing a letter . <end>
<start> he wants to come . <end>
<start> i grind my own coffee beans every morning . <end>
<start> it s too risky . <end>
<start> tom had three failed marriages . <end>
<start> tom surprised mary with a kiss . <end>
<start> stereotypes are confusing and misleading . <end>
<start> take a card . <end>
<start> help me with my homework , please . <end>
<start> i am a translator . <end>
<start> place the ladder against the wall . <end>
<start> don t you think you re lucky ? <end>
<start> i m glad you warned me before it was too late . <end>
<start> tom didn t believe what mary told him . <end>
<start> ask anyone . <end>
<start> i ll miss you very much if you go . <end>
<start> the woman tried on one hat after another , then left the hat shop . <end>
<start> tom s left . <end>
<start> i drink coffee . <end>
<start> it s hard to swat a fly with your bare hand . <end>
<start> she was very surprised when she heard the news . <end>
<start> tom came after mary left . <end>
<start> i m looking for the same thing you are . <end>
<start> even though there were many cookies on the dish , i only ate three . <end>
<start> why are you sad ? <end>
<start> do you believe in god ? <end>
<start> the united states s economy is the largest in the world . <end>
<start> we re not your enemies . <end>
<start> tom and mary always talk about the same old things . it gets kind of boring . <end>
<start> i looked after the rabbits when i was at school . <end>
<start> i am very glad to meet you today . <end>
<start> what was the secret ? <end>
<start> i m very nervous . <end>
<start> you were handsome . <end>
<start> i am ashamed of my son s laziness . <end>
<start> it costs an arm and a leg . <end>
<start> why do you like squirrels so much ? <end>
<start> are you feeling tired ? <end>
<start> my clock is two minutes fast . <end>
<start> tom felt completely helpless . <end>
<start> he was too proud to accept any reward . <end>
<start> he s a great coach . <end>
<start> i understand what you mean . <end>
<start> tom s boss is canadian . <end>
<start> we have enough seats for everyone . <end>
<start> what s going on in the cave ? i m curious . i have no idea . <end>
<start> tom and mary are playing poker . <end>
<start> i don t always follow instructions . <end>
<start> i don t know whether i will win or lose . <end>
<start> this shouldn t take too much time . <end>
<start> i couldn t go because of the heavy rain . <end>
<start> i still have so many questions to ask you . <end>
<start> everyone thinks so . <end>
<start> you should be able to read this book easily . <end>
<start> have fun this summer ! <end>
<start> i ll wait for you in the hotel tomorrow . <end>
<start> i haven t thought about it at all . <end>
<start> i think this is a terrible idea . <end>
<start> this problem is not so difficult that you can t solve it . <end>
<start> he is able to speak japanese . <end>
<start> we sat there . <end>
<start> i remember giving him the key . <end>
<start> i have to iron my shirt . <end>
<start> i never go anywhere . <end>
<start> he doesn t work as hard as he used to . <end>
<start> this is a true story . <end>
<start> tom ate pancakes for breakfast . <end>
<start> he shot at me . <end>

<start> it happened that he saw her there . <end>
<start> while driving , mind the potholes . <end>
<start> what s the plan ? <end>
<start> i m warning you not to do it again . <end>
<start> we sniffed at the food suspiciously . <end>
<start> he is the least likely to come . <end>
<start> tom threw something at me and i ducked . <end>
<start> i was not drunk . <end>
<start> are you enjoying it ? <end>
<start> everybody needs to know this . <end>
<start> isn t that terrific ? <end>
<start> look at this picture . <end>
<start> that mountain is covered in snow all year round . <end>
<start> i ll be with you in a second . <end>
<start> this temple is said to have been built over     years ago . <end>
<start> i am living the good life . <end>
<start> she wrote in ink . <end>
<start> we have five classes every day except saturday . <end>
<start> you won t be punished . <end>
<start> tom should ve trusted me . <end>
<start> i couldn t get him to stop smoking . <end>
<start> i need to find people to chill with . <end>
<start> tom didn t stop smoking , so mary left the room . <end>
<start> stop touching me . <end>
<start> how many friends do you have ? <end>
<start> tom refused mary s offer to help . <end>
<start> i m sorry about being late . <end>
<start> that is the funniest joke that i have ever heard . <end>
<start> this tie doesn t go with my suit . <end>
<start> yesterday i heard a beautiful song . <end>
<start> people don t like working with tom because he s hard to get along with . <end>
<start> they ll never know we re here . <end>
<start> look in the phone book . <end>
<start> i always leave the window open while i sleep . <end>

<start> i m a little bit jealous . <end>
<start> i was kept waiting for nearly half an hour . <end>
<start> i put bait on the hook . <end>
<start> both dogs are asleep . <end>
<start> you never know what you can do till you try . <end>
<start> i couldn t answer all the questions . <end>
<start> i don t want to wake tom up . <end>
<start> i sometimes pray in the meeting room . <end>
<start> the design itself is flawed . <end>
<start> jeans take forever to dry . <end>
<start> i go to the movies every week . <end>
<start> i guarantee i ll get you a job . <end>
<start> who is that person ? <end>

<start> please go away and stop annoying me . <end>

<start> i climbed over the fence . <end>

<start> he forgot to lock the door . <end>
<start> it s difficult to understand his ideas . <end>

<start> his name is known to everybody in this country . <end>
<start> he fascinated me . <end>

<start> that s the worst thing that could possibly happen . <end>
<start> tom didn t have a pencil . <end>

<start> he showed it to me . <end>
<start> you re the only person i know that likes getting up early in the morning . <end>
<start> i might be able to help . <end>
<start> tom didn t have to do that . <end>
<start> they went in opposite directions . <end>
<start> i don t have cash . <end>
<start> this tea is too bitter . <end>
<start> why don t you give it another try ? <end>
<start> tom fought . <end>
<start> although it rained , everyone had a good time . <end>
<start> are we good to go ? <end>
<start> why don t you study french ? <end>

<start> she lived all her life in that town . <end>
<start> i saw tom . <end>
<start> you had your chance and you blew it . <end>
<start> tom said he d be here , but i can t find him . <end>
<start> their punishment was harsh , but just . <end>

<start> her father is tall . <end>
<start> he is in love with her , but he tries to conceal his feelings . <end>
<start> tom called mary an idiot . <end>
<start> nobody reads long messages . <end>
<start> tom likes brunettes . <end>
<start> you eat too much junk food . <end>
<start> he is as tall as her . <end>
<start> tom might be there . <end>
<start> i hurried and managed to catch the bus . <end>
<start> tom walked as fast as he could to catch up with mary . <end>
<start> i really got depressed . <end>
<start> i thought you were going to help . <end>
<start> i am singing with my children . <end>
<start> i think this is enough . <end>
<start> tom wants to break up with mary . <end>

<start> he was caught in an ambush . <end>
<start> the northernmost part of the city is a maze of alleys . <end>
<start> your guests are waiting . <end>
<start> tom is incompetent . <end>

<start> he lost his position just because he refused to tell a lie . <end>
<start> i don t get along with my neighbors . <end>
<start> tom looks tense . <end>
<start> help yourself to a piece of cake . <end>
<start> can you spin a basketball on your fingertip ? <end>
<start> i don t feel like going out right now . <end>

<start> tom must have pushed the wrong button . <end>
<start> if god did not exist , it would be necessary to invent him . <end>
<start> tom went to the theater with mary . <end>
<start> a trade delegation has gone to japan ahead of the prime minister to crunch the numbers with their japanese counterparts . <end>

<start> tom is an arrogant idiot . <end>
<start> tom went on a drinking binge . <end>
<start> you re soaking wet . <end>
<start> i saw her a week ago today . <end>
<start> that sounds too good to be true . <end>

<start> many old customs are gradually dying out . <end>
<start> tom had a lot of time to think about the problem . <end>
<start> did you lie to your parents ? <end>
<start> fast is the opposite of slow . <end>
<start> the book i read yesterday was really interesting . <end>

<start> tom swims better than i do . <end>
<start> he explained how to make a fire . <end>

<start> it s freezing cold in this country . <end>
<start> tom is married to a teacher . <end>
<start> she s almost the same height as you . <end>

<start> the two cars crashed . <end>
<start> tom doesn t know who baked the cake . <end>
<start> a mosquito just bit me . <end>
<start> it was pretty cool . <end>
<start> everyone is listening to the chairperson . <end>
<start> tom certainly has the right temperament for the job . <end>
<start> i want a piece of cake . <end>
<start> furthermore , i still don t think this a huge cultural difference . <end>
<start> i guarantee it . <end>

<start> the bus is running ten minutes late . <end>
<start> how much does tom weigh ? <end>
<start> mother bought my brother a yellow umbrella . <end>
<start> don t let them scare you . <end>
<start> if you could only speak english , you would be perfect . <end>
<start> you ll get into trouble if your parents find out . <end>
<start> he listened to the music with his eyes closed . <end>
<start> i drank a liter of coffee . <end>
<start> i saw you cooking . <end>

<start> i borrowed the screwdriver from a friend of mine . <end>
<start> i told tom not to come here . <end>
<start> he robbed an old lady . <end>

<start> i am surprised to hear that prices have gone up so high . <end>
<start> tom didn t like mary . <end>

<start> tom wants to feed the birds in the park . <end>
<start> that s a very complicated question . <end>
<start> she watched him and the other boys playing baseball . <end>
<start> he felt a sudden urge to write a novel . <end>
<start> you can put it anywhere . <end>
<start> do you hear any sound ? <end>
<start> she s very beautiful . <end>
<start> i don t expect anything from you . <end>

<start> it has begun . <end>
<start> i knew something was wrong . <end>
<start> his life was full of ups and downs . <end>
<start> would you rather go sailing or swimming this afternoon ? <end>
<start> tom s safe . <end>
<start> the law says that all men are equal . <end>
<start> we re not giving up . <end>
<start> i can t buy you that dress . <end>
<start> after you . <end>
<start> he has been playing tennis since this morning . <end>

<start> my father likes fishing , and so do i . <end>
<start> i m pretty sure tom won t do anything crazy . <end>
<start> his anger is understandable . <end>
<start> tom is a believer . <end>
<start> i think we should try again . <end>
<start> why don t you just sit down here ? <end>
<start> you should ve rejected such an unfair proposal . <end>
<start> i bought it for about twelve dollars . <end>
<start> will you stay at home tonight ? <end>
<start> i will never force you to marry him . <end>
<start> tom ate alone . <end>
<start> i was hungry and thirsty . <end>

<start> this afternoon , we sang together at our house . <end>

<start> few people live to be one hundred years old . <end>
<start> i strolled along the streets to kill time . <end>

<start> tom will be thrilled . <end>
<start> i think there are many who binge eat from stress . <end>

<start> she choked him . <end>
<start> i went into the navy . <end>

<start> there s a bank on the corner . <end>
<start> what do you really think ? <end>
<start> i went to boston by train . <end>

<start> it s sort of strange . <end>
<start> tom arrived the day mary left . <end>
<start> come on , let s try it . <end>
<start> no , thank you . i m just looking . <end>
<start> you aren t permitted to bring dogs into this building . <end>
<start> tom locked the door after he entered his apartment . <end>
<start> tom is sweating . <end>
<start> his crime deserved the death penalty . <end>
<start> i use this . <end>
<start> england resembles japan in many respects . <end>
<start> she hit the ball hard . <end>
<start> i ve heard that . <end>
<start> that is enormous . <end>
<start> nobody is too old to learn . <end>
<start> there s really nothing else to say . <end>
<start> i ll postpone my trip to scotland until it s warmer . <end>
<start> recently , there have been signs that the economy is picking up steam . <end>
<start> there was an accident . <end>
<start> there are beautiful flowers in the garden . <end>
<start> i left my umbrella here , but now i can t find it . <end>
<start> this milk tastes terrible . <end>
<start> you have to memorize this sentence . <end>
<start> i did see it . <end>
<start> you know everything . <end>
<start> you may eat anything in the refrigerator . <end>
<start> tom is mary s grandfather . <end>
<start> tom says he can fix anything . <end>
<start> he stood on the edge of the cliff . <end>
<start> tom asked mary where john was . <end>
<start> are you sure you want to do this by yourself ? <end>
<start> needless to say , he was late for school as usual . <end>
<start> i like tom s attitude . <end>
<start> he stole money from her wallet . <end>
<start> thirty isn t that old . <end>
<start> i saw a man enter the room . <end>
<start> this book is too difficult for me . <end>
<start> which films are showing now ? <end>
<start> tom is in shock . <end>
<start> he is very good at playing violin . <end>
<start> i just need some time . <end>
<start> i m so tired ! <end>
<start> i have only five thousand yen . <end>
<start> there is something about him i don t like . <end>

<start> where do you want it ? <end>
<start> when will you go to germany ? <end>
<start> tell us what you want to do . <end>
<start> i didn t know that was necessary . <end>
<start> he also was very serious . <end>
<start> tom was the first one to arrive this morning . <end>
<start> how many hours a day does she spend in the kitchen ? <end>
<start> i could run quite a bit faster when i was young . <end>
<start> the boy threw stones at the dog . <end>
<start> tom moved through the dimly lit alley . <end>
<start> tom treated mary like a slave . <end>
<start> i m going to tell everybody . <end>
<start> tom was supposed to help me this afternoon . <end>
<start> leave out this word . <end>
<start> he sat on the bed . <end>
<start> they attempted to escape . <end>
<start> tom is inflating a balloon . <end>
<start> i awoke to find a burglar in my room . <end>
<start> the whole building was deserted . <end>
<start> tom is the best employee we ve ever had . <end>
<start> without your help , i couldn t have finished the work . <end>
<start> i didn t like the ending of that movie . <end>
<start> i wish she d look me in the eyes . <end>
<start> tom and mary are from the same city . <end>
<start> since he s busy , he can t meet you . <end>
<start> don t worry , mom . he isn t particular about food . he eats anything . <end>
<start> tom told mary that she looked like marilyn monroe . <end>
<start> do you wish to do that now ? <end>
<start> he s away on business . <end>
<start> she herself helped him . <end>
<start> i am busy . <end>
<start> will you teach me french ? <end>
<start> what if someone kidnapped tom ? what would you do ? <end>
<start> it is said that truth always triumphs . <end>
<start> may i take pictures here ? <end>
<start> it is a luxury cruise . <end>
<start> is today really monday ? <end>
<start> i believe you . <end>
<start> we played golf last monday . <end>
<start> the princess disguised herself as a simple shepherdess . <end>
<start> hope you had a good birthday . <end>
<start> i m against the war . <end>
<start> she s not a child . <end>
<start> i m probably not the only one who thinks it s a bad idea to do that . <end>
<start> she solved the puzzle with ease . <end>
<start> he drinks a bottle of beer at dinner . <end>
<start> i am always tense before i get on an airplane . <end>
<start> where do they do that ? <end>
<start> they murdered tom . <end>
<start> why are you looking so sad ? <end>
<start> if you only had one more week to live , what would you spend your time doing ? <end>
<start> you have to pay for utilities . <end>
<start> could you lower your voice please ? i m really hung over . <end>
<start> the referee blew his whistle to end the match . <end>
<start> once you get to know her , she is very friendly . <end>
<start> why were you absent from school yesterday ? <end>
<start> i know you don t want that to happen . <end>
<start> tom has three nieces . <end>
<start> he went off without saying good bye . <end>
<start> the air conditioner doesn t work . <end>
<start> we d better go home now . <end>
<start> she married a bank clerk . <end>
<start> i cannot understand what happened . <end>
<start> what more do you want ? <end>
<start> do we know each other ? <end>
<start> she got angry . <end>
<start> i heard an interesting rumor . <end>
<start> there are many islands in greece . <end>
<start> this is very good . <end>
<start> tom trusts me . <end>
<start> i am sorry to cancel the appointment at the last minute . <end>
<start> tom found it more and more difficult to ignore the pain . <end>
<start> i don t trust you . <end>
<start> tom is very competent . <end>
<start> i m leaving it to you . <end>
<start> she s not my girlfriend . <end>
<start> she told him a joke , but he didn t laugh . <end>
<start> tom murdered his own father . <end>
<start> louis braille , who was blind from the age of three , invented a way for the blind to read . <end>
<start> tom knew mary would arrive late . <end>
<start> he works every day except sunday . <end>
<start> he s stalling for time . <end>
<start> i really like this one . <end>
<start> don t take it to heart . <end>
<start> by the way , where are you from ? <end>
<start> get out of the classroom . <end>
<start> tom left mary in the room by herself . <end>
<start> there are lots of things to do . <end>
<start> the kid stumbled and fell to his knees . <end>
<start> can i go outside ? <end>
<start> who sings this song ? <end>
<start> at what time do you eat breakfast ? <end>
<start> i must be getting home . <end>
<start> can man live without having a social life ? <end>
<start> your office is nicer than mine . <end>
<start> she advised him to go home early . <end>
<start> he made me a suit . <end>
<start> tom was alone most of the time . <end>
<start> i d like you to meet my husband . <end>
<start> thank you , doctor . <end>
<start> what s your favorite breakfast food ? <end>
<start> do you want to play hide and seek ? <end>
<start> tom laughed at mary . <end>
<start> i never laid a finger on her . <end>
<start> please bring me some glasses . <end>
<start> open the windows . <end>
<start> he is still angry . <end>
<start> my best friend is in rome now . <end>
<start> how much is this racket ? <end>
<start> tom goes to work by motorcycle . <end>
<start> she is not honest at all . <end>
<start> you seem unconcerned . <end>
<start> tom can be clumsy . <end>
<start> the instant he opened the door , he smelt something burning . <end>
<start> my car has power windows and power door locks . <end>
<start> tom never said a word . <end>
<start> i took a taxi to get there in time . <end>
<start> he became furious . <end>
<start> she is a beauty . <end>
<start> i ve lost count . <end>
<start> tom double checked his door to make sure it was locked . <end>
<start> my brother is very important . at least he thinks he is . <end>
<start> tom should ve studied more . <end>
<start> i want to go to school in australia . <end>
<start> we must sleep at least eight hours a day . <end>
<start> you must not indulge in drinking . <end>
<start> i need coughing medicine . <end>
<start> what do you have on the menu today ? <end>
<start> i wish i had a million dollars . <end>
<start> someone visited her yesterday . <end>
<start> you ll have to study harder from now on . <end>
<start> if you do not have this program , you can download it now . <end>
<start> could you tell me your present address ? <end>
<start> i m your neighbor . <end>
<start> stories like that fascinate me . <end>
<start> go and brush your teeth . <end>
<start> it s better to walk back than to get lost . <end>
<start> i am happy with my girlfriend . <end>
<start> i refuse to answer such a stupid question . <end>
<start> tom went to the beach . <end>
<start> what do you suggest ? <end>
<start> where was she at that moment ? <end>
<start> you know something about this , don t you ? <end>
<start> tom locked himself in the bathroom and started to cry . <end>
<start> tom was proven right . <end>
<start> tom got a letter from mary today . <end>
<start> i ll expect you tomorrow unless you let me know otherwise . <end>
<start> do you want to be rich ? <end>
<start> i want you to find tom . <end>
<start> he hasn t been here long . <end>
<start> wait here while i go get your coats . <end>
<start> that s not my fault . <end>
<start> the brandy is all gone . <end>
<start> this is my school . <end>
<start> i have known her for two years . <end>
<start> a plea bargain is out of the question . <end>
<start> where s my car ? <end>
<start> mary isn t tom s wife . <end>
<start> she is a gifted artist . <end>
<start> i have four computers , but two of them are so old i don t use them anymore . <end>
<start> is that legal ? <end>
<start> he cut the advertisement out of the newspaper . <end>
<start> tom loved mary , but she didn t love him back . <end>
<start> the situation worsened . <end>
<start> you can spend the night with us . <end>
<start> i m not able to do that by myself . <end>
<start> i have to buy a car this weekend . <end>
<start> he said he would come . <end>
<start> he is often taken for a student . <end>
<start> spring is the best season to visit kyoto . <end>
<start> your camera is only half the size of mine . <end>
<start> tom is good at tennis , no question about it . <end>
<start> he made me attend the party in his place . <end>
<start> lions are stronger than wolves . <end>
<start> i can do that with one hand tied behind my back . <end>
<start> he denied having done it . <end>
<start> do you have a book ? <end>
<start> please continue . <end>
<start> he dislikes the principal . <end>
<start> this train is comfortable . <end>
<start> it is easy to be brave from a safe distance . <end>
<start> she almost fainted . <end>
<start> get the book . <end>
<start> only god knows . <end>
<start> have you ever returned home before seven ? <end>
<start> i m sorry , my boss is sleeping right now . please come back tomorrow . <end>
<start> the tree blocked the road . <end>
<start> we ve got it . <end>
<start> the ink stain will not wash out . <end>
<start> when i got up this morning , i had a headache . <end>
<start> i spent last year in boston . <end>
<start> it was at school . <end>
<start> only those who risk going too far will know how far one can go . <end>
<start> i don t think this is such a good idea . <end>
<start> tom hasn t budged for over an hour . <end>
<start> i m very anxious about my son s safety . <end>
<start> there s no beer here . <end>
<start> turn on the radio . <end>
<start> tom came close . <end>
<start> tom is more interesting than mary . <end>
<start> think it over and tell me what you decide . <end>
<start> i ll stay home . <end>
<start> you didn t eat much lunch . <end>
<start> i m sure tom will be able to persuade mary to go to boston with him . <end>
<start> someone must ve left the door open . <end>
<start> tom didn t know that mary could speak french . <end>
<start> that must ve taken place while i was away . <end>
<start> we re all from boston . <end>
<start> you ll always be special to me . <end>
<start> where did you go yesterday ? <end>
<start> tom didn t bring it . <end>
<start> ski jumping looks scary . <end>
<start> she committed suicide by jumping off the bridge . <end>
<start> mary is a warm , caring person , but tom is cold and aloof . <end>
<start> this one works . <end>
<start> i m so full . <end>
<start> he explained why the experiment failed . <end>
<start> you are always making excuses for not doing your share of the work . <end>
<start> we have a hectic week ahead of us . <end>
<start> hebrew is my mother tongue . <end>
<start> i m likely to still be doing this tomorrow . <end>
<start> the man attacked her with the intention of killing her . <end>
<start> tom asked mary for a divorce . <end>
<start> i know i can t take tom s place . <end>
<start> is that what you want , tom ? <end>
<start> the pain in my stomach has gone . <end>
<start> his explanation that a solution would take time didn t satisfy anyone . <end>
<start> do you want to drink coffee ? <end>
<start> that s going to be a problem . <end>
<start> he only speaks one language . <end>
<start> i love you more than i love her . <end>
<start> tom apologized for his son s rude behavior . <end>
<start> my mother bought my brother a yellow umbrella . <end>
<start> i turned over the business to my son . <end>
<start> why wait for christmas ? <end>
<start> he got hurt in the game yesterday . <end>
<start> do people in boston drink tap water ? <end>
<start> i cannot bear the pain any more . <end>
<start> that s what people don t understand . <end>
<start> he seems tired . <end>
<start> they won the silver medal . <end>
<start> he spends too much money . <end>
<start> why didn t you go to the office ? <end>
<start> what time will you be back ? <end>
<start> we re in the middle of a crisis . <end>
<start> these problems will be solved in the near future . <end>
<start> i want my job back . <end>
<start> tom is right , of course . <end>
<start> what would life be without hope ? <end>
<start> he can t speak english , can he ? <end>
<start> the doctor is not available now . <end>
<start> this table is made of wood . <end>
<start> when do we arrive ? <end>
<start> do you have some milk ? <end>
<start> i gave my brother a dictionary . <end>
<start> i know someone who lives in your neighborhood . <end>
<start> we had to leave for america on short notice . <end>
<start> i hate you . <end>
<start> why do you need a new umbrella ? <end>
<start> the patient was lying in the bed with his eyes closed . <end>
<start> i m allergic to peanuts . <end>
<start> i can see some small fish swimming about in the water . <end>
<start> what do you feel like doing tonight ? <end>
<start> he wiped the sweat from his face . <end>
<start> mary keeps her laptop with her at all times . <end>
<start> i believe in what they said . <end>
<start> why don t we go to the mountains this weekend ? <end>
<start> what did you do with my purse ? <end>
<start> tom and mary seem a little confused . <end>
<start> tom said he saw mary at the movie theater with john . <end>
<start> you must be here till five . <end>
<start> this data is incorrect . <end>
<start> who are you trying to convince ? <end>
<start> tom heard that mary was very rich . <end>
<start> there s no one left . <end>
<start> how did you come up with such a good idea ? <end>
<start> i can t give tom everything he wants . <end>
<start> i m sure you ll like it . <end>
<start> stars are shining in the sky . <end>
<start> he likes animals . <end>
<start> the death penalty is final and irreversible . <end>
<start> i don t understand what you re trying to say . <end>
<start> i hear that you are a good tennis player . <end>
<start> she went about the household chores . <end>
<start> i saw my sister tear up the letter . <end>
<start> i think tom knows why . <end>
<start> he took me by the arm and looked me in the eye . <end>
<start> dinosaurs died out a very long time ago . <end>
<start> i really wasn t expecting that from you . <end>
<start> tom was bald . <end>
<start> i don t know a lot of jokes . <end>
<start> tom seems distracted . <end>
<start> i want another cup of tea . <end>
<start> how long did tom work here ? <end>
<start> tom appreciated mary s help . <end>
<start> please try to be as brief as possible . <end>
<start> is that so terrible ? <end>
<start> which one do you like better ? <end>
<start> mary broke in on our conversation . <end>
<start> the sun was shining brightly . <end>
<start> mary is beautiful . <end>
<start> they began to walk after a while . <end>
<start> we re not doing anything . <end>
<start> that s what i expected of my daughter . <end>
<start> thank you for calling . <end>
<start> he doesn t understand the risks . <end>
<start> try this one . <end>
<start> i think it s time for me to get a new pair of glasses . <end>
<start> saturday is when my father is free . <end>
<start> do your work in your own way . <end>
<start> you must show your passport . <end>
<start> his sister can t talk to you today . <end>
<start> look at us . <end>
<start> tom s eyesight isn t as good as it used to be . <end>
<start> i really don t understand what all the commotion is about . <end>
<start> tom is like a brother to me . <end>
<start> i want a car , but i have no money to buy one . <end>
<start> there isn t anywhere else to park . <end>
<start> is that right ? <end>
<start> they branded him as a liar . <end>
<start> she will get along with my grandmother . <end>
<start> why did you try to run away ? <end>
<start> nobody knows why he turns down my help . <end>
<start> that s a strange problem . <end>
<start> i m from canada . <end>
<start> we entered the room by the back door . <end>
<start> i ll miss you when you re gone . <end>
<start> tom is very conceited , isn t he ? <end>
<start> tom needed mary s help . <end>
<start> he s not a doctor , but a nurse . <end>
<start> he decided to become an author . <end>
<start> i was thinking about you earlier today . <end>
<start> you may not be as lucky next time . <end>
<start> tom is willing to do almost anything for money . <end>
<start> tom shouldn t have kept mary waiting so long . <end>
<start> what s done can t be undone . <end>
<start> i have a lot of work still outstanding . <end>
<start> i guess this is goodbye . <end>
<start> do japanese people eat sushi every day ? <end>
<start> those earphones don t work . <end>
<start> don t be too dependent on others . <end>
<start> please tell me about your trip . <end>
<start> i had no difficulty in persuading my father to let me study abroad . <end>
<start> tom no longer goes out with mary . <end>
<start> tom can t answer your question . <end>
<start> which foreign language are you learning ? <end>
<start> tom recognized me . <end>
<start> tom stroked his beard . <end>
<start> not knowing what to do , i asked the teacher for advice . <end>
<start> it took    years to build the taj mahal . <end>
<start> tom had his car key in his left hand . <end>
<start> i can t play piano . <end>
<start> the chairs are made of wood . <end>
<start> i ve heard that song before . <end>
<start> i don t remember agreeing to that . <end>
<start> don t call me a jerk . <end>
<start> tom squeezed the lemon . <end>
<start> she pleaded with him to stay . <end>
<start> it s not good to stay up late at night . <end>
<start> i remember both of you . <end>
<start> i don t know where she lives . <end>
<start> my sweater shrank in the wash . <end>
<start> i don t blame you . <end>
<start> the helicopter is flying very low . <end>
<start> my doctor has advised me to stop taking this medicine . <end>
<start> they exchanged gifts . <end>
<start> perseverance , as you know , is the key to success . <end>
<start> do you know who said that ? <end>
<start> i m very sorry i came home so late . <end>
<start> i want you to know the truth . <end>
<start> he had to stand in line at the ticket office . <end>
<start> i have an earache . <end>
<start> tom and mary were in love . <end>
<start> tom is good at handball . <end>
<start> the room that the kidnappers locked me in had no windows . <end>
<start> tom forgot to sign the check . <end>
<start> how did tom get in here ? he came in through the window that you left unlocked . <end>
<start> tom giggled like a schoolgirl . <end>
<start> give it to whoever needs it . <end>
<start> i knew a guy named tom . <end>
<start> do you live alone ? <end>
<start> she looks pretty in that dress . <end>
<start> i m impressed . <end>
<start> tom served two months in jail for drunken driving . <end>
<start> there is an urgent need for social change . <end>
<start> i won t tolerate your mistakes again . <end>
<start> that club is way too big . <end>
<start> why are you acting like you don t know me ? <end>
<start> they ve gone . <end>
<start> you promised . <end>
<start> don t lean on my chair . <end>
<start> there are many kinds of coffee . <end>
<start> put the child to sleep . <end>
<start> she came back an hour later . <end>
<start> tom isn t crying . <end>
<start> this package was delivered last night . <end>
<start> how long have you waited ? <end>
<start> tom attracted a crowd of children as soon as he started playing his bongos . <end>
<start> tom doesn t like chinese food . <end>
<start> i m looking forward to seeing you again . <end>
<start> what is he up to now ? <end>
<start> how horrible ! <end>
<start> few people know what the word hipster means . <end>
<start> i hope he ll be able to come ! i d like to see him . <end>
<start> tom will be bored stiff . <end>
<start> i am waiting for my driver . <end>
<start> she was a pioneer in this field . <end>
<start> i don t know how long it ll last . <end>
<start> tom s french is excellent . <end>

<start> she promised that she would pay me this week , but she didn t keep her word . <end>
<start> look at yourself in the mirror . <end>
<start> tom might faint . <end>
<start> tom kissed her on the cheek . <end>
<start> i need to know how far it is . <end>
<start> i have to brush my teeth . <end>
<start> it snowed a lot last year . <end>
<start> where does that bus go ? <end>
<start> he is clever enough to solve the problem . <end>
<start> some people have trouble getting their dogs to eat dog food . <end>

<start> he is studying in the library now . <end>
<start> i slept . <end>
<start> he went to the store on his bike . <end>
<start> i was not conscious of her presence . <end>
<start> that will do . <end>
<start> tom ate a whole bag of marshmallows . <end>
<start> tom shouted himself hoarse . <end>
<start> you reap what you sow . <end>
<start> do you know how my friends describe me ? <end>
<start> i could not bring myself to eat it . <end>
<start> tom s enthusiasm is contagious . <end>

<start> tom didn t know who mary was at first . <end>
<start> he tried in vain to lift up the stone . <end>
<start> tom didn t know the reason why mary wanted a new dress . <end>
<start> we have to wait for him . <end>

<start> she is traveling around the world . <end>
<start> he asked his teacher for advice . <end>

<start> i don t understand why you want it . <end>
<start> he flirts with every woman he meets . <end>
<start> a great number of citizens went into the army . <end>
<start> that sounds like a job for tom . <end>
<start> tom is in good health . <end>
<start> that tall boy saved the drowning child . <end>
<start> i was fond of cake . <end>
<start> i ll be ready by monday . <end>

<start> tom went home angry . <end>
<start> tom accidentally ate some rat poison . <end>
<start> are you in a rush ? <end>
<start> i do not like him , but i like her . <end>
<start> he s trying to commit suicide . <end>
<start> mary was cruel to tom . <end>
<start> everywhere you look you can see children playing . <end>
<start> that s not what i m saying . <end>
<start> can you remember the first time you ate at this restaurant ? <end>
<start> give tom a kiss . <end>
<start> people often lie about what they did on the weekend , so their friends won t realize how boring they really are . <end>
<start> would you like to eat lunch together ? <end>
<start> i must hand in the report today . <end>
<start> he made me a new suit . <end>

<start> i don t need to tell you anything . <end>
<start> i don t want to cause any more trouble . <end>

<start> i couldn t catch what he said . <end>
<start> what is the name of that river ? <end>
<start> it s likely to snow this evening . <end>

<start> the trumpet is a musical instrument . <end>
<start> i like reading mysteries . <end>

<start> tom screamed like a woman . <end>
<start> is there anywhere i can go to find a flea market ? <end>
<start> come and get it . <end>
<start> i want another beer . <end>
<start> tom was in no mood to talk to mary . <end>
<start> i m sure i have the right number . <end>
<start> it is not far to paris . <end>
<start> aren t you in town ? <end>
<start> take your time . there s no rush . <end>
<start> i don t know when my father will come back . <end>
<start> it is risky for you to go into that area alone . <end>
<start> i took my revenge . <end>
<start> mother decided otherwise . <end>
<start> are you the one who let the dog in ? <end>
<start> tom saw mary dancing with john . <end>

<start> she got very angry with the children . <end>
<start> i didn t know you were a doctor . <end>
<start> he has the habit of scratching his head . <end>
<start> i get goose bumps when i see a horror movie . <end>
<start> tom wanted to meet you . <end>
<start> it s late . <end>
<start> he isn t actually the manager . <end>
<start> the old man lived in the three room apartment . <end>

<start> dad bought me books . <end>
<start> how s the water here ? <end>
<start> the post office isn t too far from here . <end>
<start> tom didn t have any choice . <end>

<start> the man entered the next room . <end>
<start> tom listened to the news . <end>
<start> i m thinking of going abroad . <end>
<start> i swim almost every day . <end>
<start> someone s outside . <end>
<start> he wrote a book about china . <end>
<start> tom mounted his horse and rode off . <end>

<start> i need you to find tom . <end>
<start> i guess i ll be going now . <end>
<start> last month was november , right ? <end>
<start> i want you to give tom a message . <end>
<start> he didn t want to think about it . <end>
<start> insecticides are agricultural chemicals that exterminate insects harmful to plants . <end>
<start> mark twain said , all generalizations are false , including this one . <end>
<start> i don t know what motivated me to come here . <end>
<start> we don t know what we re up against . <end>
<start> give me a cup of coffee . <end>
<start> it is difficult to play the piano . <end>
<start> i think it s highly unlikely that i ll ever see my stolen motorcycle again . <end>
<start> tom did twenty pushups . <end>
<start> i m just saying you can t blame me . <end>
<start> what is your address ? <end>
<start> i read about it in the newspaper . <end>
<start> who would you like to speak with ? <end>
<start> are you going home by bus ? <end>
<start> tom won t do that with me . <end>
<start> i thought that guy had a gun , so i shot him . <end>
<start> the syntax of python scripts is very simple . <end>
<start> can t we start over ? <end>
<start> i don t know what i want to do . <end>

<start> it will probably snow tomorrow . <end>
<start> this book is to me what the bible is to you . <end>
<start> why not ? <end>
<start> as soon as you arrive , she will make something to eat . <end>
<start> tom decided not to leave home until he was a little older . <end>
<start> who s going ? <end>
<start> can you please take this package to the post office ? <end>
<start> i m busy today , otherwise i would accept . <end>

<start> they ve left . <end>
<start> he hasn t written you a letter in a long time . <end>
<start> you re the best . <end>
<start> the ball flew through the air . <end>
<start> i don t want to get a suntan . <end>
<start> here is the house where he lived . <end>
<start> i gave the milk to the cat . <end>
<start> i have a throbbing pain here . <end>
<start> we made pancakes for breakfast . <end>
<start> i had hoped to meet you there . <end>
<start> i just want to thank you for all your help . <end>
<start> can you tell me what this is ? <end>
<start> are you hiding from tom ? <end>
<start> she forced him to do it . <end>
<start> tom ate all of the chocolate . <end>
<start> ice skating can be graceful and beautiful . <end>
<start> the boy bowed to me . <end>
<start> i was careful to not leave any evidence . <end>
<start> i ve been very busy lately . <end>
<start> how was your summer ? <end>
<start> she leaned on his shoulder . <end>
<start> thanks to your stupidity , we lost the game . <end>
<start> this is my city now . <end>
<start> where is the blanket ? <end>
<start> my sister has three times as many books as i do . <end>
<start> tom couldn t think of any reason for not going . <end>
<start> she doesn t need to work . <end>
<start> the service charge is extra . <end>
<start> who is this letter from ? <end>
<start> we don t have to go . <end>
<start> he is the tallest person in the class . <end>
<start> i think it s intriguing . <end>

<start> they bought a home with a pool . <end>
<start> my father smokes . <end>
<start> you can t blame him for the accident . <end>

<start> he introduced me to his parents . <end>
<start> i love you more than i love any other person . <end>
<start> i don t want to waste time talking to tom . <end>
<start> according to the old man i met yesterday , cockroaches can be eaten and don t taste all that bad . <end>
<start> tom s boss demands a lot of work . <end>
<start> are you talking to me ? <end>
<start> i cannot lift this stone . <end>
<start> tom doesn t watch tv . <end>
<start> they were left speechless . <end>
<start> how many times have i told you i m not doing it ? <end>
<start> all they had was one another . <end>
<start> why are you crying ? <end>
<start> why did tom want to learn french ? <end>
<start> i am convinced of her innocence . <end>
<start> tom wanted mary to help him solve the problem . <end>
<start> i ate a hot dog for lunch . <end>
<start> only a few people know how to do that . <end>
<start> tom was dressed all in black . <end>
<start> that does it . <end>
<start> they say he s very rich . <end>
<start> nobody will believe that . <end>
<start> these things aren t mine ! <end>
<start> is this your picture ? <end>
<start> who made this box ? <end>
<start> this watch costs around fifty thousand yen . <end>
<start> tom seems to be babbling . <end>
<start> that boy is really shy . <end>
<start> it is difficult for me . <end>
<start> losing my daughter has taken away my will to live . <end>
<start> the dog knew its master . <end>
<start> i went to boston . <end>
<start> tom put his shirt on . <end>
<start> i ve got a hunch something might be happening tonight . <end>
<start> they both died . <end>
<start> didn t you write a letter to him ? <end>
<start> everyone must obey the rules . those who don t will be punished . <end>
<start> where are you going to move ? <end>
<start> listen a minute . <end>
<start> his death made everyone sad . <end>
<start> the passing car splashed muddy water on me . <end>
<start> come up here . <end>
<start> he complained about the noise . <end>
<start> what are you here for ? <end>
<start> sales should double this year . <end>

<start> i saw tom kiss mary . <end>
<start> i may not be rich , but at least i have a girlfriend , said tom . <end>
<start> i need it . <end>
<start> i don t want to see you here again . <end>

<start> she doesn t know that i m japanese . <end>
<start> stars cannot be seen in the daytime . <end>

<start> the climate of japan is milder than that of india . <end>
<start> she arrived in a car . <end>
<start> you have such beautiful eyes . <end>

<start> the grapefruit tastes very sour . <end>
<start> i ve asked tom to stop doing that . <end>
<start> there are many flowers in the garden . <end>
<start> this cd costs     . <end>
<start> after knocking twice , the police had no choice but to break the door down . <end>

<start> i m anxious to see you . <end>
<start> i don t want you to enjoy it . <end>
<start> he will soon return home . <end>

<start> she agreed with him that i should go to the meeting . <end>
<start> tom is alone in the kitchen . <end>

<start> i want something to drink . <end>
<start> how deep is lake biwa ? <end>
<start> where were you coming from ? <end>
<start> no one wanted to eat . <end>
<start> we decided not to have peace negotiations with the invaders . <end>
<start> slavery is a crime against humanity . <end>
<start> i found it difficult to solve the problem . <end>
<start> tom can t handle the truth . <end>
<start> he is bound to succeed . <end>
<start> it tasted sweet . <end>
<start> when was the last time it rained here ? <end>

<start> he didn t dare say anything . <end>
<start> tom doesn t understand french very well . <end>
<start> i still need to ask tom for permission . <end>
<start> i can t understand that word . <end>
<start> for the most part , i agree with what he said . <end>
<start> apparently , tom has been cheating on his wife . <end>
<start> i have one hour to eat . <end>

<start> the guards didn t see tom . <end>
<start> tom folded his clothes and put them in his suitcase . <end>
<start> i don t know how to legally get around those regulations . <end>
<start> why don t you buy a car ? <end>

<start> two criminals escaped from prison . <end>
<start> tom shut the door quietly . <end>

<start> tom has been trying to avoid mary . <end>

<start> i know that it is highly unlikely that anyone would be willing to help me . <end>
<start> how much did they charge you to do that ? <end>
<start> i ll be seeing mary this afternoon . <end>
<start> this sounds fishy . <end>
<start> that is out of the question . <end>

<start> it seemed that he had been ill . <end>

<start> i saw him jump . <end>
<start> if you re not too busy , could you help me ? <end>
<start> this is how i solved the difficult problem . <end>
<start> tom had trouble making friends . <end>
<start> she put all her jewels into a little red box . <end>
<start> he dedicated his whole life to helping poor people . <end>

<start> i ll wait till four o clock . <end>
<start> the children were playing in the middle of the street . <end>
<start> george washington was the first president of the united states of america . <end>

<start> muammar kaddafi escaped unharmed . <end>

<start> tom lit a cigarette . <end>

<start> tom was wearing a bulletproof vest , so the bullet didn t kill him . <end>
<start> she decided to study abroad . <end>
<start> you can eat all you want . <end>
<start> what kind of girl are you ? <end>
<start> tom and mary might break up . <end>
<start> he devoted his life to his study . <end>

<start> i was following you . <end>
<start> i don t want anyone wearing my clothes but me . <end>
<start> i thought tom would show up . <end>
<start> i must be true to myself . <end>
<start> you re so negative . <end>
<start> take whichever one you like . <end>
<start> we stayed up until about      studying for today s test . <end>
<start> this girl is the most intelligent . <end>
<start> there is no salt left . <end>
<start> tom escaped injury . <end>
<start> if i were in your place , i would not do so . <end>
<start> sing us a song in french . <end>
<start> your prophecy has come true . <end>
<start> tom took care of his sick mother . <end>
<start> i can t buy this because i don t have enough money . <end>
<start> you may go . <end>
<start> tom took off his wig . <end>
<start> it was very difficult to tell the twins apart . <end>
<start> this box is not as big as that one . <end>
<start> i can t see the end . <end>
<start> tom is doing very well today . <end>
<start> the mountain climbers reached the summit before dark . <end>
<start> this is what you have to do . <end>
<start> should i buy something for him ? <end>
<start> why are you so insecure ? <end>
<start> tom always gets nervous when mary is around . <end>

<start> the student came from london . <end>
<start> the news took him by surprise . <end>
<start> thanks for coming . <end>
<start> hopefully , tom won t notice anything . <end>
<start> that s all i can do for now . <end>
<start> he noticed a letter on the desk . <end>
<start> tom works in the film industry . <end>
<start> love blinded him to her faults . <end>

<start> yesterday the unveiling of the founder s statue and the opening of the school building took place . <end>
<start> it s not that easy to learn a new language after fifty . <end>

<start> in the old days , every child could tell the difference between good and bad . <end>
<start> whether you like it or not , you ll have to do it . <end>
<start> several students were absent from school because of colds . <end>
<start> this book is adapted for children . <end>
<start> my sister has a piano . <end>
<start> unless you hurry , you will be late for school . <end>
<start> take care of your own affairs yourself . <end>
<start> that was a very inconvenient time to bring up the subject . <end>
<start> it works . <end>
<start> i m used to this kind of cold . <end>
<start> these earphones don t work . <end>
<start> according to the radio , it ll rain tomorrow . <end>
<start> her hair is long . <end>
<start> she found me a good seat . <end>
<start> tell tom i m not interested in the car he s trying to sell . <end>
<start> why is she doing this ? <end>
<start> this is fascinating . <end>
<start> please phone him . <end>
<start> never put off to tomorrow what you can do today . <end>
<start> there are too many enemies in the south . <end>
<start> i would do anything for you . <end>
<start> there s an old movie theater in town . <end>
<start> tom remembers . <end>
<start> the accident came about through my carelessness . <end>
<start> mary is a very hard working woman . <end>
<start> i think tom is illiterate . <end>
<start> we still have plenty of time , but let s take a taxi just in case . <end>
<start> i was outraged by his answer . <end>
<start> would you like to play with us ? <end>
<start> i have to buy flowers for my girlfriend . <end>
<start> tom was alone when mary and john walked in . <end>
<start> i assume you ve heard about what happened here yesterday . <end>
<start> she had scarcely finished speaking when he cut in . <end>
<start> anyone hurt ? <end>
<start> it is dangerous to drink too much . <end>
<start> the plane took off and was soon out of sight . <end>
<start> the school is closed . <end>
<start> he acted like a lunatic . <end>
<start> you will miss japanese food in the united states . <end>
<start> how did tom get it ? <end>
<start> how long can i keep this book ? <end>
<start> if i told you , you wouldn t understand . <end>
<start> i don t play the oboe . <end>
<start> she was engaged as an interpreter . <end>
<start> tom loves horses . <end>
<start> tom was a bookkeeper . <end>
<start> the snow was so thick we couldn t see in front of us . <end>
<start> i cannot do the work on my own . <end>
<start> i like the atmosphere of this restaurant . <end>
<start> many children don t like eating spinach . <end>
<start> the two teams playing tonight are the yomiuri giants and the hanshin tigers . <end>
<start> it s doubtful that tom will still be alive when his children get to the hospital . <end>
<start> where does the airport bus leave from ? <end>
<start> how much money did you win ? <end>
<start> the police are investigating the murder . <end>
<start> tom sometimes falls asleep in class . <end>
<start> i can t lift this . it s too heavy . <end>
<start> we cannot live without air . <end>
<start> she likes him . <end>
<start> you re really wonderful . <end>
<start> i respect you . <end>
<start> this idea is not rational . <end>
<start> tom had a heart tattooed on his arm . <end>
<start> the lion is eating meat . <end>
<start> the man was obsessed with fear that the secret might be disclosed . <end>
<start> tom s new shirt shrunk when he washed it and now it doesn t fit . <end>

<start> next monday is a holiday . <end>

<start> i am living with my uncle . <end>
<start> let me go ! <end>
<start> tom is going to college now . <end>
<start> he did not agree with it . <end>
<start> i m feeding the goldfish . <end>
<start> she wears the same kind of clothes as her sister wears . <end>
<start> the weather forecast is not necessarily reliable . <end>
<start> tom walked to the door and opened it . <end>
<start> tom went into his office and closed the door . <end>
<start> have you framed those paintings i brought in last week ? <end>
<start> this book belongs to tom . <end>
<start> we ll go to hong kong first , and then we ll go to singapore . <end>
<start> she ran very fast to catch up with the other members . <end>
<start> he feels at home . <end>
<start> you look like a cop . <end>
<start> bears are quite dangerous . <end>
<start> it s snowing today . <end>
<start> i think it might be dangerous for tom and me to go skin diving by ourselves . <end>
<start> it was my fault . <end>
<start> why can t animals talk ? <end>
<start> he writes scripts for tv shows . <end>
<start> give me that key . <end>
<start> i love to dance . <end>
<start> when was the last time you broke your glasses ? <end>
<start> he ll play golf even if it rains . <end>
<start> tom is no angel . <end>
<start> there s a party at tom s house tonight . <end>
<start> i already know how to drive . <end>
<start> where did you learn to drive so well ? <end>
<start> what does tom know about me ? <end>
<start> i have something to show you . <end>
<start> who cares about that ? <end>
<start> when was the last time you saw her ? <end>
<start> you re sick . you have to rest . <end>
<start> what teams were playing ? <end>
<start> i think it s time for me to leave now . <end>
<start> is that it ? <end>
<start> i guess it s ok . <end>
<start> who has eaten all the cookies ? <end>
<start> why don t you get a haircut ? <end>
<start> i m still trying to a hold of tom . <end>
<start> it is like casting pearls before swine . <end>
<start> i love nara , particularly in the fall . <end>
<start> i like your family . <end>
<start> it d be better if you didn t associate with men like that . <end>
<start> all s fair in love and war . <end>
<start> i want you to fly to boston tomorrow . <end>
<start> let s not deal with that problem right now . <end>
<start> tom denied having ever been in boston . <end>
<start> what s tom going to say about that ? <end>
<start> i find it difficult to understand french when it s spoken quickly . <end>
<start> he was exiled to an island for the crime of high treason . <end>
<start> i think tom is irresponsible . <end>
<start> ignore it . <end>
<start> a ball hit her right leg . <end>
<start> i shouldn t have asked you to do that . <end>
<start> you may go at once . <end>
<start> if tom would eat less , he d be healthier . <end>
<start> tom is incapable of losing . <end>
<start> nobody will care . <end>
<start> i don t need your money . i just need your time . <end>
<start> as a citizen of the world , i know ways of overcoming cultural barriers . <end>
<start> is it true that illegal immigrants are taking jobs away from citizens who want them ? <end>
<start> hurry home . <end>
<start> does that make it any clearer ? <end>
<start> hurry up , it s late . <end>
<start> you shouldn t have borrowed tom s car . <end>
<start> call security ! <end>
<start> bigger doesn t always mean better . <end>
<start> tom escaped from the danger . <end>
<start> did you do it by yourself ? <end>

<start> you don t usually do that by yourself , do you ? <end>
<start> i m painting an easter egg . <end>
<start> may i eat this cake ? <end>
<start> is that your own idea ? <end>
<start> tom and mary seldom eat together . <end>
<start> he can also speak french . <end>
<start> the budget must be balanced . <end>
<start> tom is insecure . <end>
<start> i was disappointed with your paper . <end>
<start> that was an awful day . <end>
<start> at    o clock yesterday , there were hundreds of people outside . <end>
<start> you weren t doing anything illegal . <end>

<start> i believe that everything will be fine . <end>
<start> what kind of movies do you like to watch ? <end>

<start> young tigers resemble cats . <end>
<start> i am more than grateful to you for your help . <end>
<start> can i go next ? <end>
<start> i won t go back with you . <end>
<start> please let me pay . <end>
<start> you look nice in that red sweater . <end>
<start> i loved her . <end>
<start> sometimes a cigar is just a cigar . <end>
<start> my brother is a professor . <end>
<start> you still haven t told me why you re here . <end>
<start> tom is signing documents . <end>
<start> people took pity on the orphan . <end>
<start> tom isn t here at the moment . <end>
<start> don t worry about this . <end>
<start> i saw tom s father . <end>
<start> the room is fully furnished . <end>
<start> you look wonderful tonight . <end>
<start> do you want to know what s wrong ? <end>
<start> my apartment isn t far from here . <end>
<start> don t forget to write me . <end>
<start> he may be there . <end>
<start> a thorough investigation is now in progress . <end>
<start> he established a friendly relationship with the natives . <end>
<start> they left their house quickly . <end>
<start> he can t be trusted . <end>
<start> never forget to put out the fire . <end>
<start> why are you folding my clothes ? <end>
<start> playing the piano is her favorite pastime . <end>
<start> you are not at all wrong . <end>
<start> among the things found were umbrellas , shoes , and handkerchiefs . <end>
<start> first come , first served . <end>
<start> that s dangerous . <end>
<start> the mayor granted our request . <end>
<start> let me see that list . <end>
<start> the stock reached its high point last july . <end>
<start> the investigation is still active . <end>
<start> he could do nothing but watch . <end>
<start> bring me the dictionary . <end>
<start> i stayed home for a week . <end>
<start> he snored all night and his wife couldn t sleep . <end>
<start> my friend is a talkative person . <end>
<start> did i do something to offend you ? <end>
<start> i got here monday night . <end>
<start> do you know how to dance ? <end>
<start> tom boarded the plane . <end>
<start> he deals fairly with people . <end>
<start> who were you talking with ? <end>
<start> i think we should do that again . <end>
<start> the car turned right when it reached the corner . <end>
<start> my husband always reads in bed . <end>
<start> she was washing the dishes . <end>
<start> tom ought to know better at his age . <end>
<start> he was humiliated by her . <end>
<start> aren t you coming to the party tomorrow ? <end>
<start> i certainly hope that ll happen . <end>
<start> my father does not eat much fruit . <end>
<start> in all the excitement , i forgot to eat . <end>
<start> i choose to be happy . <end>
<start> when to start is the main problem . <end>
<start> your tie looks good . <end>
<start> he likes to build model planes . <end>
<start> he drinks too much alcohol . <end>
<start> i hate working . <end>
<start> he will be back in ten minutes . <end>
<start> the sun doesn t always shine . <end>
<start> tom can t find what he s looking for . <end>
<start> let s go by taxi , ok ? <end>
<start> i arrived there too early . <end>
<start> it was a trap . <end>
<start> the baby has been coughing all night . <end>
<start> why don t you call a spade a spade ? <end>
<start> tom asked me for my phone number . <end>
<start> they are my sisters . <end>
<start> do you think i m too materialistic ? <end>
<start> it is difficult to speak chinese well . <end>
<start> i want you to lay back and relax . <end>
<start> it s tom s job . <end>
<start> what in the world does he mean ? <end>
<start> my girlfriend said that she d kill me if i got drunk . <end>
<start> you have to ask for permission from your teacher . <end>
<start> don t be hard on tom . <end>
<start> the parade was led by an army band . <end>
<start> he said he would write to me , but he hasn t . <end>
<start> that s a very old saying . <end>
<start> it was a beautiful sunny day . <end>
<start> you should turn off the light before going to sleep . <end>
<start> you didn t eat much lunch . <end>
<start> they re great . <end>
<start> how long have you been sitting there ? <end>
<start> give me ten minutes . <end>
<start> this book seems easy to us . <end>
<start> he wants to talk to you . <end>
<start> i ll be on my own . <end>
<start> tom won . <end>
<start> something unusual happened last night . <end>
<start> i bought a book of jokes . <end>
<start> marble floors are beautiful . <end>
<start> i love nature . <end>
<start> i have some coupons i got last week . <end>
<start> the rumor turned out to be true . <end>
<start> two plus two makes four . <end>
<start> i like roger federer . what tennis player do you like ? <end>
<start> will it hurt a lot ? <end>
<start> he misses his family . <end>
<start> he has never been late for school . <end>
<start> there s your wife . <end>
<start> have i changed that much ? <end>
<start> did you miss me ? <end>
<start> i will stay home today . <end>
<start> are we allowed to use the elevator ? <end>
<start> tom is at home almost every evening . <end>
<start> it s going nicely ! <end>
<start> he is not old enough to live alone . <end>
<start> have you ever pruned a tree ? <end>
<start> the theater used to stay open till late . <end>
<start> she wrung the juice from a lot of oranges . <end>
<start> the sun is about   ,     ,     times as large as the earth . <end>
<start> we learned english . <end>
<start> does she have a boyfriend ? <end>
<start> why do children lie to their parents ? <end>
<start> there is no link between these two . <end>
<start> there s a possibility that tom will be late . <end>
<start> we re all to blame for that . <end>
<start> it reminds me of my childhood . <end>
<start> tom ll cry . <end>
<start> i m sorry , i just wanted to help . <end>
<start> feeding pigeons is prohibited . <end>
<start> i m talking about my friend . <end>
<start> there is still serious racial hatred against black people . <end>
<start> she and i get on well . <end>
<start> whenever i get on the subway , i put my wallet in my front pocket . <end>
<start> tom was glad he didn t have to live in boston for more than a year . <end>
<start> i arrived here about five o clock . <end>
<start> do you see any policeman over there ? <end>
<start> he can t have said such a stupid thing . <end>
<start> she hasn t been to the dentist s for years . <end>
<start> nobody is speaking . <end>
<start> say nothing . <end>
<start> his ideas were too far advanced to be accepted by ordinary people . <end>
<start> tom says that he s just eaten . <end>
<start> he asked her why she was crying . <end>
<start> i think this is dumb . <end>
<start> i won t bore you with the details . <end>
<start> how many workdays are there this month ? <end>
<start> that sounds reasonable . <end>
<start> i m very impressed with your quality control . <end>
<start> you re very brave , aren t you ? <end>
<start> let s play tennis this afternoon . <end>
<start> get lost ! <end>
<start> eat a live frog every morning , and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day . <end>
<start> you must go at once . <end>
<start> tom is upset about this . <end>
<start> where did you find this wallet ? <end>
<start> this is wonderful . <end>
<start> i must help these people . <end>
<start> i went fishing with my brother in the river . <end>
<start> some animals are afraid of fire . <end>
<start> tom postponed his trip to boston . <end>
<start> drink up your milk . <end>
<start> knock on the door before entering the room . <end>
<start> i like her a lot . <end>
<start> if you watch the sun setting on a warm , damp day , you can see the moisture changing the shape of the sun . <end>
<start> you re the one who knows how to do this , right ? <end>
<start> they are sensible girls . <end>
<start> you won t have that problem . <end>
<start> can you tell me your address ? <end>
<start> tom wouldn t go without saying goodbye . <end>
<start> tom hasn t unpacked yet . <end>
<start> i like to travel by myself . <end>
<start> she breaks something every time she cleans the room . <end>
<start> tom is brushing his teeth . <end>
<start> the house was trashed . <end>
<start> i want to dive into the river . <end>
<start> what have you done this week ? <end>
<start> they don t like cats . <end>
<start> wait for me there . <end>
<start> she is a clerk in the supermarket . <end>
<start> i had to lie to my parents . <end>
<start> she writes with her left hand . <end>
<start> almost all of the passenger in the bus were asleep when the accident happened . <end>
<start> it seems that she was ill . <end>
<start> shampoo and toothpaste are the same price . <end>
<start> what a shock ! <end>
<start> god created the heaven and the earth . <end>
<start> it s a dead giveaway . <end>
<start> the soldiers lost the courage to fight . <end>
<start> is the phone ringing ? <end>
<start> she went blind . <end>
<start> she plays tennis in the morning . <end>
<start> why does he always behave so badly ? <end>
<start> let s try write a song together . <end>
<start> i might not do that . <end>
<start> how easy is it to find a part time job ? <end>
<start> he loves his daughter , but his wife doesn t . <end>
<start> do any of you have anything to say in connection with this ? <end>
<start> the girl had no one to turn to for advice . <end>
<start> i have to check and see what the contract says . <end>
<start> i wish i had a beautiful girlfriend . <end>
<start> i m just a little surprised . <end>
<start> tom hates raw onions . <end>
<start> thank you for coming all the way to see me . <end>
<start> you are actresses . <end>
<start> leave our house . <end>
<start> tom isn t fighting , is he ? <end>
<start> we re still friends . <end>
<start> the last thing i d ever want to do is hurt tom . <end>
<start> my parents come from china . <end>
<start> i can t believe i m even considering this . <end>
<start> they believed he was honest . <end>
<start> it s hard to believe that tom could murder someone . <end>
<start> i m not busy now . <end>
<start> tom was chosen by lottery . <end>
<start> why are you so tired today ? <end>
<start> are you still around ? <end>
<start> that s what you think . <end>
<start> the situation changed the following year . <end>
<start> this is a beautiful country . <end>
<start> we see what we expect to see . <end>
<start> this dog minds well . <end>
<start> i don t know how you did it . <end>
<start> he s not stupid . <end>
<start> one learns by doing . <end>
<start> what s gone wrong ? <end>
<start> i lost my sense of direction in the snowstorm . <end>
<start> tom and mary lost their jobs due to budget cutbacks . <end>
<start> i know the man you came with . <end>
<start> i went fishing . <end>
<start> tom knows how to fly a helicopter . <end>
<start> i did my best . <end>
<start> birds learn to fly by instinct . <end>
<start> tom avoided making any comment on the matter . <end>
<start> tom tried not to listen to mary and john discussing their financial situation . <end>
<start> i hope i didn t make you feel uncomfortable . <end>
<start> are you a cop ? <end>
<start> a lot of people were waiting for him . <end>
<start> write in ink . <end>
<start> we saw the car start . <end>
<start> my hobby is visiting old temples . <end>
<start> he s gone senile . <end>
<start> how much do you want to spend ? <end>
<start> i like pizza . <end>
<start> i don t recognize any of the people in the picture . <end>
<start> that s my fault . <end>
<start> the air became warm . <end>
<start> i ll remember you forever . <end>
<start> i need a box of nails . <end>
<start> i thought you weren t interested in politics . <end>
<start> i won t betray tom . <end>
<start> i always keep my word . <end>
<start> tom was stranded when his car conked out in the middle of nowhere . <end>
<start> have you lost your mind ? <end>
<start> my wisdom teeth are coming in . <end>
<start> she s a fox . <end>
<start> he took me by the arm . <end>
<start> tom is kind of tall . <end>
<start> why do you think tom and mary are planning to get divorced ? <end>
<start> an architect occupies that office . <end>
<start> why haven t you told tom how much he owes ? <end>
<start> is that clock going ? <end>
<start> i would ve liked that . <end>
<start> i am very grateful for your help . <end>
<start> i didn t take part in the conversation . <end>
<start> tom whistled a tune as he walked along the river . <end>
<start> i need to know what s going on . <end>
<start> his brother came home soon after . <end>
<start> buffalo bones were made into tools . <end>
<start> i have nothing to say to you . <end>
<start> has this ever been done before ? <end>
<start> some people say thirteen is an unlucky number . <end>
<start> the pain of losing a child is indescribable . <end>
<start> the mother of that child is an announcer . <end>
<start> i never give up . <end>
<start> i regret that i can t help you . <end>
<start> i was taking a bath . <end>
<start> i still can t speak french . <end>
<start> hurry up , or you ll be late . <end>
<start> i don t even know who she is . <end>
<start> let s see what happens . <end>
<start> tom says that he never dreams . <end>
<start> he seems to know the secret . <end>
<start> what s that thing ? <end>
<start> japan is an industrial nation . <end>
<start> the captain was the last person to leave the sinking ship . <end>
<start> this vending machine is out of order . <end>
<start> she said she had met him on the previous day . <end>
<start> everyone praises the boy . <end>
<start> you don t need to go at once . <end>
<start> he soon got used to the new surroundings . <end>
<start> give us a minute , would you ? <end>
<start> tom s remark was insensitive . <end>
<start> you must be the new teacher . <end>
<start> it s been a while since i ve studied french . <end>
<start> can anybody else answer ? <end>
<start> tom is hiding behind the door . <end>
<start> turn off the light and go to sleep . <end>
<start> furniture made of good materials sells well . <end>
<start> i think you had better stick to your present job . <end>
<start> i studied hard in order to pass the examination . <end>
<start> i am sure i ll get along with him because we are from the same prefecture . <end>
<start> don t exert yourself . <end>
<start> tom and mary were not famous . <end>
<start> i ll take the next bus . <end>
<start> my doctor advised me to give up smoking . <end>
<start> i thought the captain ordered you not to do that . <end>
<start> can i help you ? <end>
<start> i don t want to spend more than     . <end>
<start> what happened ? there s water in the whole apartment . <end>

<start> i will ask him where he went last sunday . <end>
<start> you don t have to hide your feelings . <end>
<start> i ll come and see you one of these days . <end>
<start> once in a while , he leaves his umbrella on the train . <end>
<start> people are talking . <end>
<start> tom felt trapped . <end>
<start> they are about the same age . <end>
<start> the scars are barely visible . <end>
<start> he and i stayed at the hotel . <end>
<start> he is an expert at fishing . <end>
<start> my dream has come true . <end>
<start> his explanation doesn t make sense at all . <end>
<start> it s never too late to learn . <end>
<start> tokyo has a population of over ten million . <end>
<start> i have a few things i want to make clear . <end>
<start> tom doesn t care what happens . <end>
<start> the doctor tried hard to save the wounded boy . <end>
<start> you have a big problem . <end>
<start> there is no water . <end>
<start> i have the answer . <end>
<start> he had fifty dollars . <end>
<start> tom has you to thank for his success . <end>
<start> it s raining , but i would like to go out . <end>
<start> i really don t want to go to boston with tom . <end>
<start> tom looks a lot better today . <end>
<start> he had no friend to help him . <end>
<start> what s the nearest planet to the sun ? <end>
<start> when i first met tom , i was eighteen . <end>
<start> don t be a backseat driver . <end>
<start> all men have equal rights . <end>
<start> children play in this park every day . <end>
<start> it s not going to end well . <end>
<start> please do not smoke here . <end>
<start> he is washing the car . <end>
<start> to prevent the disease from spreading quickly was not an easy task . <end>
<start> i found his house easily . <end>
<start> tom needs two tickets to boston . <end>
<start> despair drove him to attempt suicide . <end>
<start> ice hockey is an exciting sport . <end>
<start> we bought new furniture . <end>
<start> the moon is shining brightly . <end>
<start> it s just that easy . <end>
<start> he has been sick for a week . <end>
<start> i can t help you . as a matter of fact , i m very busy just now . <end>
<start> many people use atms to withdraw money . <end>
<start> she banged the table with her fist . <end>
<start> tom likes her . <end>
<start> which direction will he choose ? <end>
<start> tom unlocked the door and entered the office . <end>
<start> i m going downtown . <end>
<start> how about february   th around      pm ? <end>
<start> he will be here in half an hour . <end>
<start> you have no idea how distressed she was . <end>
<start> tom wants me on his team . <end>
<start> the castle is beautiful . <end>
<start> i spent last sunday relaxing at home . <end>
<start> where did the accident take place ? <end>
<start> tom asked mary many questions that she couldn t answer . <end>
<start> i found the boy sound asleep . <end>
<start> there s no way i m doing that . <end>
<start> he used to live here . <end>
<start> now what do we do ? <end>
<start> don t touch this ! <end>
<start> there was no other choice but to abandon the entire project . <end>
<start> of all the famous baseball players , he stands out as a genius . <end>
<start> we can all do this . <end>
<start> i ve been dyeing my hair for the last three years . <end>
<start> tom s hat blew off . <end>
<start> write the date of your birth . <end>
<start> i answered the question . <end>
<start> in my room , there are no clocks . <end>
<start> this is your handbag . <end>
<start> you can t sell it . <end>
<start> what s tom talking about now ? <end>

<start> she s very pretty . <end>
<start> i thought your remark was interesting . <end>
<start> i like your garden . <end>
<start> you re stronger than the rest of us . <end>
<start> tom and mary just got married last year . <end>
<start> it was surprising that she said that . <end>
<start> if i want something , i get it . <end>
<start> my mother has sold everything that is dear to her . <end>
<start> the school rules require students to wear school uniforms . <end>
<start> i cannot get rid of my cough . <end>
<start> you should not sleep . <end>
<start> she killed a hamster thinking that it was a mouse . <end>
<start> he didn t see anybody . <end>
<start> have you decided to go to japan ? <end>
<start> tom won t tell us anything . <end>
<start> the religious man remained kneeling for hours . <end>
<start> this is the reason i came here . <end>
<start> it rained for a week . <end>
<start> there were at least a hundred people present . <end>
<start> tom doesn t like swimming in pools . he prefers swimming in lakes and rivers . <end>
<start> if she knew your address , she would write to you . <end>
<start> i do remember the incident quite well . <end>
<start> all of us were surprised at the news . <end>
<start> sometimes i wish i had a different religion . <end>
<start> those girls look like guys . <end>
<start> don t do it ! it s stupid and dangerous . <end>
<start> i was expecting a letter from her . <end>
<start> how old is this airplane ? <end>
<start> i don t know if i can do it . <end>
<start> he s got the biggest eyebrows i ve ever seen . <end>
<start> she needs our help . <end>
<start> watch me . <end>
<start> no news is good news . if you haven t heard from your son it s because he s doing well . <end>
<start> tokyo is a huge city . <end>
<start> they re already here . <end>
<start> we ate way too much last night . <end>
<start> this book is worthy of attention . <end>
<start> it s impossible to see rome in a day . <end>
<start> why don t you ask me what you really want to know ? <end>
<start> is she healthy ? <end>
<start> what did you do with my purse ? <end>
<start> she looks at least sixty . <end>
<start> he is a student at a high school . <end>
<start> tom has enough money to buy any computer in this store . he just needs to decide which one . <end>
<start> that s an ugly building , in my opinion . <end>
<start> i ll miss tom , too . <end>
<start> tom doesn t have any plans for tomorrow . <end>
<start> tom drinks like a fish . <end>
<start> that was very rude . <end>
<start> that s amazing ! <end>
<start> i have borrowed a table . <end>
<start> she ll come even if you tell her not to . <end>
<start> he cheated on the test by copying from the girl in front . <end>
<start> i have a ton of things to do . <end>
<start> he is always complaining . <end>
<start> tom is dumb and immature . <end>
<start> i can t see who tom is talking to . <end>
<start> i ll need to make some more tests . <end>
<start> a fox came along . <end>
<start> tom , this is mary . <end>
<start> you look worn out . <end>
<start> do you have a bigger frying pan ? <end>
<start> one drop of the poison is enough to kill     people . <end>
<start> bring wine . <end>
<start> i need to let tom know . <end>
<start> i have no idea what i m supposed to do . <end>
<start> what you said was very interesting . <end>
<start> nobody s laughing . <end>
<start> that s the most important thing i ve learned from you . <end>
<start> i m being good to you this morning . <end>
<start> no one can blame you for being a little nervous . <end>
<start> this is the perfect place . <end>
<start> tom definitely had problems with his oldest son . <end>
<start> you should be more careful . <end>
<start> he didn t do it on purpose . <end>
<start> don t get angry . <end>
<start> i think it s a wild goose chase . <end>
<start> you re my enemy . <end>
<start> there s nothing you could ve done to prevent that from happening . <end>
<start> you re going to die . <end>
<start> a cloud floated across the sky . <end>
<start> the thunder frightened the students . <end>
<start> it will take a little time to get used to wearing a wig . <end>
<start> often , the less there is to justify a traditional custom the harder it is to get rid of it . <end>
<start> i like the simplicity of her dress . <end>
<start> i like to be at home . <end>
<start> i have the right to say what i think . <end>
<start> take us there . <end>
<start> she took advantage of my ignorance . <end>
<start> i threw up three times . <end>
<start> i ve done everything . <end>
<start> tom is scaring the crows away . <end>
<start> it s only when i can t sleep at night that the ticking of the clock bothers me . <end>
<start> i ve got tom s address somewhere on my computer . <end>
<start> tom lowered his voice and told mary that he loved her . <end>
<start> he is adept at telling lies . <end>
<start> here s my card . <end>
<start> plastic does not burn easily . <end>
<start> tom is mary s cousin . <end>
<start> are you sure you don t want to go to the doctor ? <end>
<start> i am too short . <end>
<start> speak slowly , please . <end>
<start> don t spend more than you earn . <end>
<start> she is guilty of stealing . <end>
<start> i don t want to get involved in this . <end>
<start> i am playing volleyball now . <end>
<start> you ve invited your friends too , haven t you ? <end>
<start> this fruit has a bad taste . <end>
<start> you go to school , right ? <end>
<start> that was the source of his troubles . <end>
<start> here s the address . <end>
<start> when i was in school , i really hated writing essays . <end>
<start> world war i broke out in      . <end>
<start> i need a little more time . <end>
<start> tom wanted mary to drive him to the airport . <end>
<start> he did his best . <end>
<start> i wonder if tom is still baffled . <end>
<start> that makes you even more attractive . <end>
<start> he insulted our team . <end>
<start> you re useless . <end>
<start> she is a leader in her field . <end>
<start> i m writing a letter . <end>
<start> i can t accept this gift . <end>
<start> did that really happen to him ? <end>
<start> he took pictures of me with his camera . <end>
<start> they live there . <end>
<start> the picture is in black and white . <end>
<start> are you in there ? <end>
<start> tom entered without knocking . <end>
<start> i think your skirt s too short . <end>
<start> tom said very little . <end>
<start> make it smaller . <end>
<start> it snowed all last night . <end>
<start> the servants worked like ants . <end>
<start> it makes no difference to me whether he comes or not . <end>
<start> our boss turned down our proposal . <end>
<start> when he was a child , he would go fishing on sundays . <end>
<start> i have only myself to blame , i suppose . <end>
<start> she didn t send me any letter . <end>
<start> would you like to talk to a lawyer ? <end>
<start> have you been there before ? <end>
<start> i am studying to be a translator or interpreter . <end>
<start> i m running behind schedule . <end>
<start> she returned from a trip . <end>
<start> why do people not always tell the truth ? <end>
<start> that fish is not edible . <end>
<start> tom took his wedding ring off . <end>
<start> my family is not all that large . <end>
<start> do you know how to eat with chopsticks ? <end>
<start> i m sending tom to boston to help you . <end>
<start> how s the weather in new york ? <end>
<start> he came just as i was leaving . <end>
<start> tom looked through the menu . <end>
<start> i spoke with him about the matter . <end>
<start> shouldn t you be at school today ? <end>
<start> tom is currently working on that problem . <end>
<start> i wonder how tom feels about this . <end>
<start> let me in , please . <end>
<start> do you want me to leave the light on ? <end>
<start> you re really beautiful . <end>
<start> they made fun of me . <end>
<start> tom is a very decent fellow . <end>
<start> in most western countries , young people come of age at    or    . <end>
<start> playing the guitar is fun . <end>
<start> i think we ve all made mistakes . <end>
<start> tom has a modest two bedroom house in boston . <end>
<start> i have a dentist appointment . <end>
<start> tom nodded his head in agreement . <end>
<start> it is important to remember who your friends are . <end>
<start> three out of four americans believe in the existence of paranormal phenomena . <end>
<start> it rained hard all day . <end>
<start> how s tom doing ? <end>
<start> i ve just come back . <end>
<start> when did tom get back ? <end>
<start> when i opened the door , i saw that she was sleeping . <end>
<start> why did you say such a stupid thing ? <end>
<start> no one succeeds in the world without effort . <end>
<start> after you . <end>
<start> start singing . <end>
<start> the traffic is heavy here , especially in the morning . <end>
<start> it looks like i m not needed here . <end>
<start> try to make sure tom doesn t do something stupid . <end>
<start> it is unfortunately true . <end>
<start> he violated a law . <end>
<start> you can talk here . <end>
<start> my son has always been very independent . <end>
<start> a resolution to the problem was more difficult than we anticipated . <end>
<start> let me think for a while . <end>
<start> don t you realize everything tom said was a lie ? <end>
<start> no other mountain in japan is as high as mt . fuji . <end>
<start> what s so strange about that ? <end>
<start> go meet tom . <end>
<start> tom walked to the window and looked outside . <end>
<start> why should i hire you ? <end>
<start> you have to speak english . <end>
<start> tom asked mary if she wanted to ride his horse . <end>
<start> tom never listens to mary . <end>
<start> what did you do that for ? <end>
<start> tom owes mary money . <end>
<start> it s a good way to make friends . <end>
<start> he will return from europe soon . <end>
<start> tomorrow is the last day of school ! <end>
<start> make yourself at home . <end>
<start> i have to put a stamp on the envelope . <end>
<start> the forest was so thick that one could hardly walk through it . <end>
<start> i want to go to london . <end>
<start> at first , i thought they were sick . <end>
<start> rats carry the plague . <end>
<start> tom told the children that they could stay in this room as long as they didn t make any noise . <end>
<start> the japanese have a lot in common with the chinese . <end>
<start> what s taking so long ? <end>
<start> were you at home yesterday ? <end>
<start> get out of my office . <end>
<start> tom thinks mary can speak french . <end>
<start> he s your father . <end>
<start> he arrived with me . <end>
<start> i m going to be an uncle . <end>
<start> tom begged mary not to do that . <end>
<start> don t go back to sleep ! <end>
<start> the good thing about this electronic dictionary is that it s easy to carry . <end>
<start> what is going on ? <end>
<start> spending time with your family should be your priority . <end>
<start> tom isn t up yet . <end>
<start> he doesn t want to admit that he has a drinking problem . <end>
<start> tom eats too fast . <end>
<start> tom outlived mary . <end>
<start> send this message to as many people as you can . <end>
<start> tom wanted mary to cook dinner . <end>
<start> tom had no problem doing it . <end>
<start> are you coming to the store with me ? <end>
<start> it s dark in here . <end>
<start> it s very important . <end>
<start> my father has a restaurant . <end>
<start> sao paulo is the biggest producer of eggs in the country . <end>
<start> are you in favor of the new law ? <end>
<start> he entered the room . <end>
<start> everyone knows about tom . <end>
<start> crocodiles have sharp teeth . <end>
<start> tom asked for some more time . <end>
<start> the sickness is taking its course . <end>
<start> i don t understand what he said . <end>
<start> where s the shovel ? <end>
<start> that s hers . <end>
<start> why are we fighting ? <end>
<start> it s like a drug . <end>
<start> chivalry isn t dead . <end>
<start> i will see him after i get back . <end>
<start> he does not watch tv at all . <end>
<start> tom does much better than mary does at school . <end>
<start> i can see you re not as open minded as i thought you were . <end>
<start> i m so tired . i m not even sure whether i ll be able to survive this day . <end>
<start> the policy of the government was criticized by the opposition party . <end>
<start> he started singing . <end>
<start> that s his private website . <end>
<start> i don t exercise a lot these days . <end>
<start> drop your weapons ! <end>
<start> you should come to class on time . <end>
<start> let s face it , it s impossible . we re never gonna make it . <end>
<start> i got lost , and to make matter worse , it began to rain . <end>
<start> eat whichever one you like . <end>
<start> tom works too much . <end>
<start> this water is deep . <end>
<start> some of them are my friends . <end>
<start> it takes years to master a foreign language . <end>
<start> tom waited his turn . <end>
<start> i like this perfume . <end>
<start> he doesn t listen to me . <end>
<start> i haven t been feeling so great . <end>
<start> tom doesn t want to take any chances . <end>
<start> there must be some misunderstanding between us . <end>
<start> i want to join an athletic club . <end>
<start> you are to hand in your report by      tomorrow . <end>
<start> i ll set you free . <end>
<start> tom wouldn t have done something like that . <end>
<start> he hid in an abandoned building . <end>
<start> oh ! i m sorry to hear that . <end>
<start> the heavy rain prevented me from going out . <end>
<start> would you like more mashed potatoes ? <end>
<start> who s the captain of this ship ? <end>
<start> which do you want ? <end>
<start> after her husband s death , she brought up the two children all by herself . <end>
<start> my father gets up early . <end>
<start> i don t know how to thank you . <end>
<start> i m going to the supermarket to buy some eggs . <end>
<start> the meeting broke up at four . <end>
<start> i asked tom if i could talk to him in private . <end>
<start> my mother takes a nap every afternoon . <end>
<start> you may swim . <end>
<start> i don t go in for that sort of thing . <end>
<start> did you go to cairo or alexandria ? <end>
<start> everybody feels comfortable with him . <end>
<start> he was constantly borrowing money from me . <end>
<start> i ll join you later . <end>
<start> i called you in here to ask you a question . <end>
<start> i wanted red shoes . <end>
<start> do you want to go back to boston ? <end>
<start> tom went down the river in a canoe . <end>
<start> i didn t think you d remember . <end>
<start> i m not against outlawing guns . <end>
<start> i m not hungry anymore . <end>
<start> she s unbelievably naive . <end>
<start> i m kind of busy right now , tom . <end>
<start> tom and mary fight all the time . <end>
<start> i should have taken the doctor s advice . <end>
<start> they disappeared . <end>
<start> i can t eat raw eggs . they have to be cooked . <end>
<start> she got married at the age of seventeen . <end>
<start> i didn t think you were so old . <end>
<start> the wine and the beer are good . <end>
<start> nobody cares what you think . <end>
<start> i don t want to drive . <end>
<start> i m no rebel . <end>
<start> i can t control myself . <end>
<start> well , i have to go now . <end>
<start> he suddenly stopped talking . <end>
<start> i am going to do it . <end>

<start> there s no need for you to talk so loud . <end>
<start> i sell clothing online . <end>
<start> i have never been to america . <end>
<start> i want to see tom . <end>
<start> it s hard to believe that tom wasn t aware that mary was in love with him . <end>
<start> i m glad you could come . <end>
<start> the only room available is a double . <end>
<start> think of all the fun you ve been missing . <end>
<start> i never said that to you . <end>
<start> the price depends on the size . <end>
<start> all the houses in town were empty . <end>
<start> the lake is surrounded by mountains . <end>
<start> he was born in the   th century . <end>
<start> they believe in a life after death . <end>
<start> why don t you leave , tom ? <end>
<start> unexpected results were announced . <end>
<start> it s easy to find an example . <end>
<start> he gave his life for his country . <end>
<start> you seem to be thinking of something else . <end>
<start> she s dieting . <end>
<start> that island is american territory . <end>
<start> he lives close by . <end>
<start> how do you pronounce this word ? <end>

<start> he ll answer your letter soon . <end>
<start> have you and tom ever worked together ? <end>
<start> we closed the office early today . <end>
<start> tom ate the chocolate donut that i had smuggled into the hospital . <end>
<start> the explosion came about by accident . <end>
<start> she put the picture back in his hand . <end>
<start> i m sorry i bothered you . <end>
<start> he waited for the elevator to come down . <end>
<start> i ll miss you when you re gone . <end>
<start> he hung up before i could say anything . <end>
<start> please remember to mail the letter on your way home . <end>

<start> i will start after he comes . <end>
<start> if i had wings , i would fly to you . <end>
<start> i run ten kilometers a day . <end>
<start> i know who you all are . <end>
<start> tom shut his mouth . <end>
<start> this is a very old book . <end>
<start> all our effort ended in failure . <end>
<start> this is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen . <end>
<start> it was half full . <end>
<start> it s in my pocket . <end>
<start> could you please not smoke in this room ? <end>

<start> she is eight months pregnant . <end>
<start> i can t wait to see your halloween costume . <end>
<start> we understand why . <end>
<start> she has the habit of clearing her throat whenever she s nervous . <end>
<start> suddenly the telephone rang . <end>
<start> the tv s on . <end>
<start> breast cancer is a disease . <end>
<start> you should avoid binge eating . <end>
<start> he is a man of action . <end>
<start> i leave home before eight o clock every morning . <end>
<start> i m totally confused . <end>
<start> we are having a meeting . <end>
<start> i like to eat watermelon . <end>
<start> tom lives on the same street as mary . <end>
<start> i don t feel safe here . <end>
<start> people must learn to be satisfied . <end>
<start> i m sure that he s happy . <end>
<start> i am not going to betray you . <end>
<start> that will save me a lot of trouble . <end>
<start> tom liked mary . <end>
<start> the village is connected with our town by a bridge . <end>
<start> what sort of jewelry are you going to wear with this dress ? <end>
<start> they sat by the fireplace . <end>
<start> tom made fun of mary s accent . <end>
<start> he goes to bed at eight o clock . <end>
<start> i don t cry easily . <end>
<start> he s completely crazy . <end>
<start> if it is fine tomorrow , we ll go on a picnic . <end>
<start> you worry too much about your weight . <end>

<start> i thought tom was at school . <end>
<start> i feel your pain . <end>
<start> tom likes the idea . <end>
<start> have you arrived at a decision yet ? <end>
<start> who told the story to you ? <end>
<start> she caressed her baby lovingly . <end>
<start> tom must lose a little weight . <end>
<start> tom invited mary to boston . <end>
<start> tom built his own house . <end>
<start> it was just a matter of time . <end>
<start> i don t love you anymore . <end>

<start> i wasn t on time for school this morning . <end>
<start> the newspaper said that contact with the plane had been lost . <end>
<start> mary is tom s younger sister . <end>
<start> tom was eaten by a tiger . <end>
<start> you look very tired . <end>
<start> that was harsh . <end>
<start> tom was working . <end>
<start> i ll meet you in the lobby at three . <end>
<start> he is blind in one eye . <end>
<start> my husband is out of work and looking for a job . <end>
<start> who will do it ? <end>
<start> tom denied that he had stolen anything . <end>
<start> i can help you . <end>
<start> it was a beautiful sunny day . <end>
<start> first of all , may i have your name , please ? <end>
<start> i don t want that one . <end>
<start> i don t know what the matter is . <end>
<start> will you really come ? <end>
<start> please fill this bucket with water . <end>
<start> i hope tom is right . <end>
<start> tom stayed awake all night . <end>
<start> many employees had to be laid off due to budget cutbacks . <end>
<start> i always eat out . <end>
<start> it was night . <end>
<start> i don t want something like this to happen . <end>
<start> i didn t believe you . <end>
<start> my wife cooks well . <end>
<start> i was curious to know why people had been staring at me . <end>

<start> i d like to help . <end>
<start> how much is it worth to you ? <end>
<start> the airport is closed . <end>
<start> the professor smiled . <end>
<start> tom and mary are waiting with john . <end>
<start> go with these men . <end>
<start> why don t you ask tom yourself ? <end>
<start> things got weird . <end>
<start> it is said that time heals all the wounds . <end>
<start> a crowd of people gathered to see the parade . <end>
<start> take care when you cross the street . <end>
<start> i want to see your older sister . <end>
<start> do you want to talk about it ? <end>
<start> this is not to his liking . <end>
<start> tom was quite good looking when he was young . <end>
<start> you have to use the money wisely . <end>
<start> you can use my help . <end>
<start> why worry about tom ? <end>
<start> i don t share your opinion . <end>
<start> who would do such a stupid thing ? <end>
<start> they only want tom . <end>
<start> he has no choice but to resign . <end>
<start> it wasn t very good . <end>
<start> it isn t possible to clear the snow from every road . <end>
<start> tom isn t budging on this one . <end>
<start> the dining car s at the front end of the train . <end>
<start> tom lies to mary all the time . <end>
<start> you must hurry up . <end>
<start> how s your christmas shopping coming along ? <end>
<start> tom needs a change of scenery . <end>
<start> do you have to work tonight ? <end>
<start> tom still doesn t know what happened . <end>
<start> where is the boy ? <end>
<start> i m looking forward to your reply . <end>
<start> he was very worried about having to spend christmas in the hospital . <end>
<start> tom put his hat on and went outside . <end>
<start> it was not until i left school that i realized the importance of study . <end>
<start> reading books is interesting . <end>
<start> they re about to leave . <end>
<start> i d like to invite you to the party . <end>
<start> i wonder if something has happened . <end>
<start> i work for an oil company . <end>
<start> i want to find out what kind of music tom likes . <end>
<start> tom said he was afraid . <end>
<start> you d better call the doctor . <end>
<start> it is going to rain this afternoon . <end>
<start> i ll wash dishes . <end>
<start> tom slumped back in his chair . <end>
<start> stop babbling . <end>
<start> the water s cold . <end>
<start> they didn t know what to do with him . <end>
<start> it was fabulous . <end>
<start> tom and mary were both shocked by what john did . <end>
<start> i just don t want to catch your cold . <end>
<start> i ll lend you what little money i have on me . <end>
<start> i had a healthy breakfast . <end>
<start> he often attributes his success to his wife . <end>
<start> i think tom doesn t have the ability to solve the problem . <end>
<start> send us your reaction . <end>
<start> the french flag is blue , white , and red . <end>
<start> tom is a good guitarist . <end>
<start> i m beginning to lose patience . <end>
<start> the alarm rang and everyone rushed out . <end>
<start> let s start as soon as he comes . <end>
<start> i d rather not meet him . <end>
<start> tom wants to meet me . <end>
<start> what s wrong with what we were doing ? <end>
<start> the baby smiled at me . <end>
<start> these are real . <end>
<start> all the floors in her house are made of wood . <end>
<start> he is reputed the best lawyer in this city . <end>
<start> tom told mary to wash the dishes . <end>
<start> let s leave it at that for now . <end>
<start> you did not answer my question . <end>
<start> tom uses two computers at the same time . <end>
<start> i will go regardless of the weather . <end>
<start> i want to tell you something . <end>
<start> i want you to go back to boston tomorrow . <end>
<start> tom doesn t seem to be a canadian . <end>
<start> i m a little sick . <end>
<start> do you want me to help you with your homework ? <end>
<start> i no longer like you . <end>
<start> i ll wait here until she comes . <end>
<start> is it possible to get to boston by train ? <end>
<start> they made me come here . <end>
<start> i love this mobile phone . <end>
<start> children should play outside . <end>
<start> i ve lost my lunch money . <end>
<start> a true scientist wouldn t think like that . <end>
<start> i seem to have left my umbrella behind in the train . <end>
<start> it s not good to read in a dark room . <end>
<start> empty cans were scattered about the place . <end>
<start> do what you believe is right . <end>
<start> i ve started learning esperanto . <end>
<start> tom is the same age as i am . <end>
<start> we obeyed the rules . <end>
<start> ninety five percent of orphans are older than   years old . <end>
<start> tom may use my video camera if he wants to . <end>
<start> i know what you do . <end>
<start> we must ve missed something . <end>
<start> what lovely eyes she has ! <end>
<start> tom was a very funny man . <end>
<start> they re more than friends . <end>
<start> let go of my arm ! i can t stand people touching me . <end>
<start> i just wanted to know what time tom would arrive . <end>
<start> everything you said was false . <end>
<start> does your stomach hurt ? <end>
<start> it will get warmer soon . <end>
<start> it doesn t matter what he said . <end>
<start> in      , roger miller recorded a song called you don t want my love . today , this song is better known as in the summer time . it s the first song he wrote and sang that became popular . <end>
<start> do you still hate french ? <end>
<start> the police found tom s body in a shallow grave behind the barn . <end>
<start> tom usually goes to work by car . <end>
<start> monday s not good . <end>
<start> tom followed us . <end>
<start> the house is on top of the hill . <end>
<start> has the world gone mad ? <end>
<start> tom was hoping to win the first prize . <end>
<start> it was in      that the titanic sank during her first voyage . <end>
<start> is this seat reserved ? <end>
<start> i still haven t done it . <end>
<start> the dogs were happy . <end>
<start> you should free those animals from the cage . <end>
<start> the ice is too hard to crack . <end>
<start> let s pretend we re happy together . <end>
<start> my wife beats me . <end>
<start> she terrified him . <end>
<start> i think it s highly unlikely that we ll be able to escape from this prison . <end>
<start> tom was about to leave when mary knocked on the door . <end>
<start> i found out about it on the news . <end>
<start> you are easily distracted . <end>
<start> i like chicken . <end>
<start> i missed going out with her and eating at our favorite restaurant . <end>
<start> as you sow , so shall you reap . <end>
<start> we ordered    minutes ago . <end>
<start> i am not older than he is . <end>
<start> you seem happy to me . <end>
<start> it seems almost too good to be true . <end>
<start> he left the country after his grandfather s death . <end>
<start> sometimes people make wrong decisions . <end>
<start> could you wake me up at the same time tomorrow ? <end>
<start> it must ve been tough for you . <end>
<start> you re probably tired after such a long flight . <end>
<start> i wouldn t miss your wedding for anything . <end>
<start> tom may not want to sing , but you should ask him anyway . <end>
<start> his lecture had a large audience . <end>
<start> i want a picture of that dog . <end>
<start> that seems suspicious . <end>
<start> you can say whatever you like . <end>
<start> you were right after all . <end>
<start> he left japan for america . <end>
<start> tom is dyeing his hair . <end>
<start> you may get it free of charge . <end>
<start> tom told us to be patient . <end>
<start> where were you for the whole afternoon ? <end>
<start> i don t know anything about japan . <end>
<start> tell tom i love him . <end>
<start> what would you do ? <end>
<start> if i read this book once more , i shall have read it three times . <end>
<start> take me to your leader . <end>
<start> he came down with the flu . <end>
<start> i want to stay with you . <end>
<start> is tom in trouble again ? <end>
<start> stop saying that ! <end>
<start> there is nothing in this world that i am afraid of . <end>
<start> are you busy ? <end>
<start> i m all ears . <end>
<start> that s correct . <end>
<start> we don t have that long . <end>
<start> he deceived his friend . <end>
<start> we ll need shelter . <end>
<start> i have lots of canadian friends . <end>
<start> tom is the taller of the two boys . <end>
<start> come at eleven without fail . <end>
<start> kids are smarter than you think . <end>
<start> are you studying ? <end>
<start> to make a long story short , everything went fine . <end>
<start> be careful with that knife . <end>
<start> at first i did not like him , but now i do . <end>
<start> i don t have an empty cup . <end>
<start> after you . <end>
<start> tom is drowning . <end>
<start> he never laughs . <end>
<start> it s difficult to help people who can t admit they need help . <end>
<start> i am very glad to hear of your success . <end>
<start> not only were we hungry , but we were also suffering from thirst . <end>
<start> fat people are hard to kidnap . <end>
<start> he needed to rest . <end>
<start> i don t want to go outside . <end>
<start> i know you have a girlfriend . <end>
<start> i stayed up all night . <end>
<start> industry as we know it today didn t exist in those days . <end>
<start> i don t feel like waiting any longer . <end>
<start> tom shouldn t have come here . <end>
<start> thanks for coming over tonight . <end>
<start> we are comfortable in our new house . <end>
<start> he tries . <end>
<start> i want to leave . <end>
<start> it doesn t bother me to walk in the rain . <end>
<start> he has trouble remembering names . <end>
<start> i used to take a walk early in the morning . <end>
<start> he has a long neck . <end>
<start> is there a bus that goes to the mall ? <end>
<start> will you do me the honor of dining with me ? <end>
<start> the capital city of the netherlands is amsterdam . <end>
<start> this book is a little out of date . <end>
<start> i went a different way . <end>
<start> a person who steals deserves punishment . <end>
<start> i ve told you over and over again not to do that . <end>
<start> tom won t survive much longer . <end>
<start> it belonged to my father . <end>
<start> it can t be true . <end>
<start> he is always willing to help others . <end>
<start> i don t want to be part of this . <end>
<start> we are fully aware of the importance of the situation . <end>
<start> when would you like to see him ? <end>

<start> don t be absurd . <end>
<start> by the way , did you hear that mary quit her job ? <end>
<start> we will be back tonight . <end>
<start> may i ask you a question ? <end>

<start> the priest gave me his blessing . <end>
<start> it s my first time here . <end>
<start> tom politely pretended not to notice that mary had been crying . <end>
<start> that question is under discussion . <end>
<start> why do you all look so happy ? <end>
<start> tom is fascinated . <end>
<start> do you think tom is unsociable ? <end>
<start> he sat with his legs crossed . <end>
<start> reading books is very interesting . <end>
<start> is he right ? <end>
<start> i told you it wouldn t work . <end>
<start> sixty percent of japanese adult males drink alcoholic beverages on a regular basis . <end>

<start> tom hung up on mary . <end>
<start> shall we talk about it over a cup of coffee ? <end>

<start> there was a woman here earlier looking for you . <end>
<start> my father hates the summer heat . <end>
<start> i could not help laughing at his jokes . <end>

<start> he was completely worn out . <end>
<start> is it true that tom went to boston ? <end>

<start> they are seeking a solution . <end>
<start> i d like to think so . <end>
<start> can you repair my shoes ? <end>
<start> tom did well considering his age . <end>

<start> i m not sure it s a good idea . <end>
<start> he didn t see a thing . <end>
<start> he does not believe in evolution . <end>
<start> there was nothing he could have done . <end>
<start> tom is just staring at the computer screen . <end>
<start> tom only wears black clothes . <end>
<start> dad isn t home . <end>
<start> tom went there to talk to mary . <end>
<start> the poor people were at the mercy of the cruel dictator . <end>

<start> that s a pretty big snake . <end>
<start> i think tom may be a genius . <end>
<start> are you in favor of the workers getting more money ? <end>
<start> i left my passport somewhere . <end>
<start> the british have a lot of respect for law and order . <end>
<start> you promised . <end>
<start> nobody ever helps me . <end>
<start> he took my umbrella without so much as asking . <end>
<start> there was no answer to my question . <end>
<start> where is my umbrella ? <end>
<start> the sheep in the field are eating grass . <end>
<start> they must have been tired . <end>
<start> why do you have so many cats ? <end>

<start> the kids are picking flowers in the garden . <end>
<start> i think it s time for me to change my plans . <end>

<start> tom tried to smile , but couldn t . <end>
<start> we ve figured it out . <end>
<start> to tell the truth , i am not your father . <end>
<start> they made fun of me . <end>
<start> she told some jokes and sang some funny songs at a patient s beside . <end>
<start> tom is patient . <end>
<start> tom and i chatted for a while . <end>
<start> i think i ve forgotten something . <end>

<start> he wants only the best . <end>
<start> i don t know if she will come . <end>
<start> i want you to do me one last favor . <end>
<start> i think watching tv is a waste of time . <end>
<start> there were no railroads in japan at that time . <end>
<start> nobody came to the party . <end>
<start> can you recommend a hotel ? <end>
<start> the boy looked pleased with his new bicycle . <end>
<start> he is five feet tall . <end>
<start> are they arriving at ten o clock in the morning or at night ? <end>
<start> he was worn out when he got home . <end>
<start> eat your soup before it gets cold . <end>
<start> they ll be fine . <end>
<start> i ll talk to tom later . <end>
<start> he doesn t know what he s supposed to do . <end>

<start> i didn t dare do that . <end>
<start> have i said something wrong ? <end>
<start> why didn t you come earlier ? <end>

<start> i was surprised to see a lion . <end>
<start> he had a mild heart attack . <end>
<start> they don t want to talk to me . <end>
<start> what time are you coming back ? <end>
<start> it was his first job . <end>

<start> tom doesn t know which color to choose . <end>

<start> she expected him to take the bribe . <end>
<start> tom always looks happy . <end>
<start> i m doing my homework . <end>
<start> the addict died from a drug overdose . <end>
<start> he can mask his feeling if the occasion calls for it . <end>
<start> tom arrived after mary had already left . <end>
<start> let s split a salad . <end>
<start> it s the perfect size . <end>
<start> you speak fluent english . <end>
<start> i checked the time on the clock . <end>
<start> my father used to say that money is not everything . <end>
<start> life is unfair . <end>
<start> so you re a man after all . <end>
<start> hunting is not allowed in national parks . <end>
<start> that policeman promised to look into the matter . <end>
<start> what s the hurry ? <end>
<start> why don t you talk to tom ? <end>
<start> anteaters and aardvarks are similar . <end>
<start> the picture was painted by picasso . <end>
<start> the reporters were hunting for news . <end>
<start> the two of us split up last year . <end>
<start> suddenly , a man stepped in front of them . <end>
<start> my internet connection was cut off . <end>
<start> i can see you re good at this . <end>
<start> the rain stopped . <end>
<start> we should sit down . <end>
<start> may i do it right now ? <end>
<start> he always ate fruit for dessert . <end>
<start> may i eat this apple ? <end>
<start> we re going . <end>
<start> i had heard that he was fat , but i didn t think he would be that fat . <end>
<start> tom listened . <end>
<start> i ll meet her tomorrow . <end>

<start> it s a blessing in disguise . <end>
<start> a few people have two cars . <end>

<start> i think of you all the time . <end>
<start> how complex is it ? <end>
<start> when he returned home , the kids were already asleep . <end>

<start> tom promised mary he wouldn t tell john . <end>
<start> that doesn t worry me at all . <end>
<start> that is the shop where i used to work . <end>
<start> she wanted him to stay longer . <end>
<start> if i were a rich man , i would buy you a diamond ring . <end>
<start> we got to know each other rather well on our recent trip . <end>
<start> i come from a large family . <end>
<start> will this much food do for a week s camping ? <end>
<start> i feel like i ve become someone else . <end>
<start> we agreed to start early . <end>
<start> i want that . <end>
<start> after that , he went home . <end>
<start> hand me the wrench . <end>
<start> there is nothing i can do to change that . <end>
<start> the storm didn t cause any damage . <end>
<start> tom doesn t have any brothers . <end>
<start> the dog barked . <end>
<start> rain is forecast for this evening . <end>
<start> that s quite remarkable . <end>
<start> as far as i know , he has never been overseas . <end>
<start> he did what his conscience dictated . <end>
<start> tom caught mary . <end>
<start> how far is it from here to your house ? <end>
<start> i finished all my work early . <end>
<start> i thought you might need our help . <end>
<start> she was indignant at the way she had been treated . <end>
<start> he is a british citizen , but lives in india . <end>
<start> tom was on the verge of tears . <end>
<start> he doesn t like to wait until the last moment to do something . <end>
<start> i m glad to see you back . <end>
<start> the scenery was beautiful beyond description . <end>
<start> tom brushed his teeth . <end>

<start> she advised him to come by      . <end>
<start> it looks easy when you do it . <end>
<start> tom doesn t think that will ever happen . <end>
<start> my husband won t let me get a job . <end>
<start> my son is ashamed of his behavior . <end>
<start> tom is paying attention to his budget . <end>
<start> he heard a noise . <end>
<start> i don t like people staring at me . <end>
<start> tom needs to stay where he is . <end>
<start> it is illegal in the united states for law enforcement to use torture to get information . <end>
<start> you look very beautiful tonight . <end>

<start> whether you like it or not , you must do it at once . <end>
<start> put your gun down . <end>
<start> i won t have tom doing your chores . <end>
<start> we don t even know who s going to be there . <end>
<start> are you for or against the proposal ? <end>

<start> tom began to suspect that mary was cheating on him . <end>
<start> things are changing quickly . <end>

<start> you re being very unfair to me . <end>
<start> tom is going to try it again . <end>
<start> when will you return ? <end>

<start> how much money do you think tom makes ? <end>
<start> i can t get over it . <end>

<start> is she satisfied ? <end>
<start> when was this car washed ? <end>

<start> i took it for granted that you would join us . <end>
<start> she gave her entire life to the study of physics . <end>
<start> i cannot run because i am very tired . <end>
<start> here comes the bus ! <end>

<start> i didn t think he would come . <end>
<start> does it hurt a lot ? <end>
<start> he risked his life to save her . <end>
<start> this place is ours . <end>
<start> it isn t worth repairing this car . <end>
<start> do you think so ? <end>
<start> lightning precedes thunder . <end>
<start> tom told the doctor that he felt no pain . <end>
<start> comb your hair before you go out . <end>
<start> she knows the truth . <end>
<start> my father is too stubborn to admit his faults . <end>
<start> it will soon be dark . <end>

<start> tom never saw mary again . <end>
<start> he broke his leg in the baseball game . <end>

<start> he knows a lot about animals . <end>
<start> why would i kill your dog ? <end>
<start> i think this is a waste of time . <end>

<start> he went by me without noticing me . <end>
<start> you have made the very same mistake again . <end>
<start> i appreciate the advice . <end>

<start> i d say yes if i were you . <end>

<start> she was anxious about her children s health . <end>
<start> he had discovered a new star . <end>
<start> i assume you know who did this . <end>
<start> tom s parents wanted him to study harder . <end>

<start> he put on his glasses and began to read . <end>
<start> this question is very simple . <end>
<start> tom found the treasure at the bottom of the lake . <end>
<start> did you see him go out ? <end>
<start> we re almost there . <end>
<start> what you are saying is absolutely wrong . <end>

<start> tom and mary kissed again . <end>

<start> we re still together . <end>

<start> tom isn t afraid to fail . <end>
<start> tom asked me if i knew how to swim . <end>
<start> aren t you hot ? <end>
<start> i m sure he mistook me for my sister . <end>
<start> it would be better to be blind than to see that . <end>
<start> it s a pity you don t know how to dance . <end>
<start> tom and mary were sitting on the ground . <end>
<start> berries can be frozen . <end>

<start> tom and mary were also in the car . <end>
<start> the old woman was nearly run over . <end>
<start> tom s house was destroyed by a tornado . <end>
<start> i asked her to dance . <end>

<start> tom was wearing a blue shirt and blue jeans . <end>
<start> i don t really like you . <end>
<start> it s your birthday today , isn t it ? <end>

<start> tom is going to break up with mary . <end>
<start> he sent me a present . <end>

<start> it s possible tom might not come . <end>
<start> we re coming back tomorrow . <end>
<start> that guy is completely nuts ! <end>
<start> i have no idea who tom s wife is . <end>
<start> let s go out for a walk . <end>

<start> tom got mary to drive john and alice home . <end>
<start> tom wrote a letter to mary . <end>
<start> i got a farewell present from everyone . <end>
<start> that s something you ll regret . <end>

<start> that s exactly what i thought . <end>
<start> i share everything with tom . <end>
<start> he has recovered his health , so he is now able to resume his studies . <end>
<start> i ve got no worries . <end>
<start> it s very surprising . <end>

<start> did you say    ? <end>
<start> i heard the front door slam . <end>
<start> he behaved as if he were crazy . <end>
<start> the storm prevented me from going out for a walk . <end>
<start> tom got a grip on his emotions . <end>
<start> her job was to type all the letters . <end>
<start> why don t you just call for help ? <end>
<start> you weren t supposed to come today . <end>
<start> you can easily find the bank . <end>

<start> any amount of money will be welcome . <end>
<start> his house is there on the right . <end>
<start> pay your rent in advance . <end>
<start> it just feels different . <end>
<start> she s already forgotten about you . <end>
<start> the final score was two to nothing . <end>
<start> tom knew everything . <end>
<start> he broke the world record . <end>
<start> write an answer . <end>
<start> what time did that happen ? <end>
<start> let s go to the factory . <end>

<start> something very strange is going on . <end>
<start> the building that i saw was very large . <end>
<start> no sooner had we reached the station than it began to rain . <end>
<start> if tom does that , he s sure to regret it . <end>
<start> this book is old . <end>

<start> what s the title of your new book ? <end>
<start> tom began to pull on his jeans . <end>
<start> he didn t give an answer to the question . <end>
<start> tom forgot to feed his dog . <end>
<start> hi , come on in . <end>
<start> tom has found mary . <end>

<start> they knelt down and prayed that the war would end soon . <end>
<start> i just want you to be involved . <end>
<start> is there something that you want to tell me ? <end>

<start> she married a hotshot lawyer from new york . <end>
<start> tom went pale . <end>
<start> women are meant to be loved , not to be understood . <end>

<start> i cannot read without glasses . <end>

<start> you told me not to tell anybody . <end>

<start> what do your friends call you ? <end>
<start> it was a bad choice . <end>
<start> do you still love me ? <end>
<start> i think it s time for me to move to the suburbs . <end>
<start> tom is a little concerned about mary . <end>
<start> tom knows i m here . <end>
<start> mathematics is her weak point . <end>
<start> you were my friend . <end>
<start> i m dying for a cold drink . <end>
<start> the scar on his cheek hardly shows now . <end>
<start> when was the last time you fried an egg ? <end>
<start> the old man lives on his pension . <end>
<start> i m going home now . <end>
<start> they condemned him for his cruelty to animals . <end>
<start> all three of these are mine . <end>
<start> tom and mary walked out , leaving john alone . <end>
<start> it could be dangerous to do what tom is asking us to do . <end>
<start> all the students study english . <end>
<start> do you have any tickets left ? <end>
<start> i d like a cup of tea . <end>
<start> could you drive more slowly ? <end>
<start> i like the melody of this song . <end>
<start> it had snowed . <end>

<start> i thought tom would want to see this movie . <end>
<start> they eat dinner at twelve o clock . <end>
<start> stop that car . <end>
<start> they re worried . <end>
<start> i admire your talent . <end>

<start> craps is a game of chance played with dice . <end>
<start> she had the kindness to help me . <end>
<start> you shouldn t trust your memory so much . <end>
<start> there is no shame in admitting one s faults . <end>
<start> we re lucky tom is here to help us do this . <end>
<start> tom has been in movies and on tv . <end>
<start> it was the worst moment of my life . <end>
<start> take the money and run . <end>
<start> he s a talented writer . <end>
<start> it s against the rules . <end>
<start> scientists are fighting to stem the spread of the aids virus . <end>
<start> why haven t you told tom when and where the meeting will be ? <end>
<start> you are very fortunate that you have such friends . <end>
<start> they re right behind me . <end>
<start> you re big . <end>
<start> the airplanes climbed very high . <end>
<start> tom set a trap . <end>
<start> it was not clear whether they had accomplished it or not . <end>
<start> do you have the tickets ? <end>
<start> i don t think any more students want to come . <end>
<start> he knows how to drive a truck . <end>
<start> i won t tolerate your mistakes again . <end>
<start> you can t kill us all . <end>
<start> i just want to go home . <end>
<start> tom convinced mary . <end>
<start> where are you going ? <end>
<start> the mere idea of swimming across the river made me tremble . <end>
<start> france was at war with russia . <end>
<start> don t talk nonsense ! <end>
<start> his work is washing cars . <end>
<start> you ve got a fever . <end>
<start> it is getting colder and colder day by day . <end>
<start> tom is devious . <end>
<start> when we are away from home , nothing gives us more pleasure than to receive a parcel from home . <end>
<start> we spent the whole evening talking to them . <end>
<start> i need to find a job . <end>
<start> it can happen to anybody . <end>
<start> he packed his lunch in a paper bag . <end>
<start> mary raised the mattress in order to change the sheets . <end>
<start> who was that sitting in front of you at the movies ? <end>
<start> whose son are you ? <end>
<start> i stared her in the face . <end>
<start> i no longer live in boston . <end>
<start> he knows the area like the back of his hand . <end>
<start> i like your dogs . <end>
<start> there re no lights . <end>
<start> tom often drinks a little wine after dinner . <end>
<start> they say that that drug is not safe . <end>
<start> she made a bet with him . <end>
<start> tom would rather stay . <end>
<start> she listens to religious music . <end>
<start> he is looking forward to it . <end>
<start> she told him not to worry . <end>
<start> i want you to sit here . <end>
<start> they soon adjusted themselves to the new circumstances . <end>
<start> i used to dream about being a successful businessman . <end>
<start> even smart people are sometimes absent minded . <end>
<start> christmas is only a few days away . <end>
<start> tom s plan didn t sound stupid . <end>
<start> we can cure some types of cancer . <end>
<start> you can t judge a person if you don t know him well . <end>
<start> they must really hate me . <end>
<start> tom had never spoken to mary before that time . <end>
<start> my house is only five minutes  walk from the station . <end>
<start> you must keep your room clean . <end>
<start> this is a duplicate copy . <end>
<start> i can t hide my feelings . <end>

<start> tom needed some money to buy something for mary . <end>

<start> i twisted my ankle . <end>
<start> he has a good memory . <end>
<start> the room is full of flowers . <end>

<start> tom realized something wasn t right . <end>
<start> the thought flashed through her mind that she was going to die . <end>
<start> i wish they would stop fighting . <end>
<start> tom leaned forward and tapped the cab driver on the shoulder . <end>
<start> tom began to believe that he d never be able to walk again . <end>
<start> when they finally found him , it was too late . <end>
<start> he explained the literal meaning of the sentence . <end>
<start> i think tom might be mad at me . <end>

<start> this is the last time . <end>
<start> the village is located high up in the mountains . <end>
<start> it was very difficult . <end>
<start> always being honest is no easy thing . <end>

<start> how do you think i feel ? <end>
<start> where are the other girls ? <end>

<start> i m waiting to see tom . <end>
<start> there s no coffee . <end>
<start> i don t believe he is a lawyer . <end>
<start> he likes singing and dancing . <end>
<start> tom will give mary the details later . <end>
<start> i don t want anything from you . <end>
<start> tom had no right to do what he did . <end>
<start> i feel my age . <end>
<start> the bomb exploded with a blinding flash . <end>
<start> is this your first trip abroad ? <end>
<start> is it about ten o clock ? <end>
<start> tom likes to do things by himself . <end>
<start> the birds are singing in the trees . <end>
<start> they sat down . <end>
<start> the train arrived in london . <end>
<start> where are you going now ? <end>
<start> look at the blackboard , everyone . <end>
<start> it s never too late to learn . <end>
<start> my mother took my temperature . <end>
<start> his patience is worn out . <end>
<start> how many girls do you have ? i only have one . <end>
<start> i can prove it . <end>
<start> it is needless to say that an experienced person will do better than someone without experience . <end>
<start> tom always seems to be reading something . <end>
<start> technology solved many of the problems . <end>
<start> she did not agree to the proposal . <end>
<start> i have already changed my clothes . <end>
<start> i ve had enough . <end>
<start> tom fired first . <end>
<start> which did you choose ? <end>
<start> she is not only pretty , but also bright . <end>
<start> i think it s time for me to apologize to her . <end>
<start> he kept on crying . <end>
<start> therefore , it is necessary to reduce the cost . <end>
<start> many campaign songs were written . <end>
<start> you are apt to be forgetful . <end>
<start> we didn t see many deer in the forest . <end>
<start> father gave up cigarettes . <end>

<start> how many rooms are there on the second floor of your house ? <end>
<start> everybody has to eat . <end>
<start> i ll try to distract them . <end>

<start> tom wondered what was on mary s mind . <end>
<start> i dreamed i was eating an apple pie . <end>
<start> i m literate . <end>
<start> where s my brother ? <end>
<start> are you looking for something ? <end>
<start> tom isn t watching tv now . <end>
<start> leave my stuff alone . <end>
<start> my father took us to the zoo . <end>
<start> to hear him talk , you might think he s a girl . <end>
<start> he turned his back on the old traditions . <end>
<start> this was a mistake . <end>
<start> we didn t expect an unveiling of the plan this soon . <end>
<start> i think that tom lives somewhere around here . <end>
<start> this painting is a good copy of the original . <end>
<start> that s serious . <end>
<start> i saw somebody steal the merchandise . <end>
<start> i am so busy that i don t watch tv . <end>
<start> he holds stocks in this company . <end>
<start> i was hoping you could give me a hand . <end>
<start> i m going to sell my house . <end>
<start> it shouldn t be like that . <end>
<start> this painting isn t worth the price you re asking . <end>
<start> kids like ice cream . <end>
<start> i ll think about it . <end>
<start> she told me an interesting story . <end>
<start> this room is too dark . <end>
<start> milk is a popular beverage . <end>
<start> i hate when tom does that . <end>
<start> get real . <end>
<start> are you interested in buddhism ? <end>
<start> may i ask you something ? <end>
<start> are you having a good time ? <end>
<start> i want to know what happened to your car . <end>
<start> tom knew that salads were healthy , so he ate at least one salad a day . <end>
<start> i go home right after work . <end>
<start> here comes the bus . <end>
<start> tom is the president of the local astronomy club . <end>
<start> tom asked mary what she had been doing all morning . <end>
<start> i ll try not to spill anything . <end>
<start> i think he s interested in you . <end>
<start> tom kicked mary . <end>
<start> you cannot burn anything without oxygen . <end>
<start> when is the intermission ? <end>
<start> the police shot tom s tires out . <end>
<start> i asked tom to come . <end>
<start> she has been practicing the piano since morning . <end>
<start> business is slow . <end>
<start> he and i are such close friends that we can almost read each other s minds . <end>
<start> what he says is absolutely correct . <end>
<start> your lips are red . <end>
<start> do you want me to stay ? <end>
<start> it was raining when we left , but by the time we arrived , it was sunny . <end>
<start> tom gave mary a romantic kiss . <end>
<start> i know him by sight , but not by name . <end>
<start> bears are very dangerous . <end>
<start> can you stay for a few days ? <end>
<start> this can t be true . <end>
<start> what have you done ? <end>
<start> tom managed to escape from the room where his kidnappers had kept him locked up . <end>
<start> i need thread to sew on this button . <end>
<start> she can tell the most outrageous lie without batting an eye . <end>
<start> thirteen is a lucky number in the brazilian federal lottery . <end>
<start> far from hesitating , she willingly offered to help me . <end>
<start> how could you be so irresponsible ? <end>
<start> five plus three is eight . <end>
<start> i don t want tom to talk to mary . <end>
<start> i m absolutely furious . <end>
<start> he ran away when he saw me . <end>
<start> i go to school at seven o clock . <end>
<start> sit down here and warm yourself . <end>
<start> this is not safe . <end>
<start> tom will have to do the work . <end>
<start> it can t be tom . <end>
<start> they agreed to meet me here . <end>
<start> tom didn t have the courage to pull the trigger . <end>
<start> these books are worth reading at least once . <end>
<start> tom doesn t care what other people say about him . <end>
<start> tom knows what mary likes . <end>
<start> she always asks the same question . <end>
<start> i don t need anything from you . <end>
<start> i understood tom s point of view . <end>
<start> mary is interested in politics . <end>
<start> thank you . <end>
<start> we don t need you . <end>
<start> where are my kids ? <end>
<start> i m attaching three files . <end>
<start> japan surpasses china in economic power . <end>
<start> is tom here ? <end>
<start> she is the only friend i have . <end>
<start> we went to see turtles on the beach . <end>
<start> they made the right choice . <end>
<start> he was put in prison . <end>
<start> it uses solar power . <end>
<start> he was mad at me because i broke up with him . <end>
<start> i plan on finishing that in two or three minutes . <end>
<start> he was the king of rock and roll . <end>
<start> may i start eating now ? <end>
<start> answer the question . <end>
<start> may i go to the restroom ? <end>
<start> i don t speak japanese . <end>
<start> do not take any notice of him . <end>
<start> she put the magazine on the table . <end>
<start> don t kill the goose that lays the golden eggs . <end>
<start> i don t usually have to work on sundays . <end>
<start> please wait for me . <end>
<start> tom saw where mary lives . <end>
<start> don t you have any money ? <end>
<start> they knew me . <end>
<start> be punctual . <end>
<start> tom told mary she didn t have to worry about john anymore . <end>
<start> two divisions have surrendered . <end>
<start> some of them have committed suicide . <end>
<start> i m happy to see you here . <end>
<start> i had my car stolen . <end>
<start> i want them to give me my money back . <end>
<start> it will do harm to us . <end>
<start> my name is tom . <end>
<start> i d understand anything coming from you . <end>
<start> i don t want to go back to prison . <end>
<start> he likes potato salad . <end>

<start> why didn t you tell me about this ? <end>
<start> they re too dangerous . <end>
<start> i wanted to know why you didn t come yesterday . <end>
<start> this is a special occasion . <end>
<start> he got out of the cab in haste . <end>
<start> tom is not as old as you . <end>
<start> what should we do ? <end>
<start> you had better learn either english or french . <end>
<start> the robot was so lifelike that it was uncanny . <end>
<start> i did that at school . <end>
<start> there s hardly any hope that he ll win the election . <end>
<start> you must be hiding something . <end>
<start> tom squeezed mary s hand . <end>
<start> the prophecy came true . <end>
<start> you ve lost a lot of blood . <end>
<start> i d do it again . <end>
<start> tom won t be happy to see you . <end>
<start> i found out how to solve the problem . <end>
<start> what s it like ? <end>
<start> i m proud of you . <end>
<start> tom didn t kiss mary . <end>
<start> would you mind turning down the volume ? <end>
<start> give him the benefit of the doubt . <end>
<start> if it weren t for music , the world would be a dull place . <end>
<start> can t we work this out ? <end>
<start> my mother has good handwriting . <end>
<start> nobody cares what happens to tom . <end>
<start> once you have made a promise , you should keep it . <end>
<start> i have never seen them anywhere . <end>
<start> when did that last happen ? <end>
<start> can i use your telephone ? <end>
<start> tom can go whenever he likes . <end>
<start> he was tenacious . <end>
<start> the doorbell rang . <end>
<start> if you find a mistake , please leave a comment . <end>
<start> my father s company is on the verge of bankruptcy . <end>
<start> what is the racoon doing in the kitchen ? <end>
<start> he gave me a curt answer . <end>
<start> i moved out of my parent s house to live on my own . <end>
<start> you will gain nothing from doing that . <end>
<start> the stain disappeared after we washed the shirt . <end>

<start> mary is carrying a watermelon . <end>
<start> how did tom get home ? <end>
<start> we saw the military attache of the american embassy . <end>
<start> i doubt that tom has finished his homework . <end>
<start> you re doing fine . <end>
<start> in order to do that , you have to take risks . <end>
<start> would you be willing to help ? <end>
<start> they were , for the most part , college students . <end>
<start> i told tom no . <end>
<start> he ll be late for the meeting . <end>
<start> i don t need you . <end>
<start> there s no doubt that he s innocent . <end>

<start> i had hoped that he would recover . <end>

<start> it s prohibited in most countries . <end>
<start> i have a much better idea . <end>
<start> my brothers and i all share a room . <end>
<start> they sat in a circle . <end>
<start> thank you for bringing your computer . <end>
<start> since you have nothing to do with this matter , you don t have to worry . <end>
<start> tom didn t hear the rooster crow . <end>
<start> tom s goal is to own a home before he s thirty . <end>

<start> unlike my brother , i cannot swim . <end>
<start> thanks for asking . <end>
<start> these problems have arisen as a result of indifference . <end>
<start> she smiled at me while she sang a song . <end>
<start> she adores him . <end>
<start> she left the office immediately after work . <end>
<start> write the alphabet in capitals . <end>
<start> please stay . <end>
<start> there is a television in the room . <end>
<start> tom is a good student , isn t he ? <end>
<start> we won t be doing that . <end>
<start> if he hadn t been eating while driving , he wouldn t have had an accident . <end>
<start> i am ready to give up my position . <end>
<start> tom parked in his usual spot . <end>
<start> i don t like your boss . <end>
<start> i don t know what went on last night , but they re not speaking to each other this morning . <end>
<start> i like to wear clogs . <end>
<start> fifteen more minutes and i ll be out of here . <end>
<start> tom reads three or four books a month . <end>
<start> tom came with me . <end>
<start> anyone can make a mistake . <end>
<start> all the people who were here have left . <end>
<start> when will you get home ? <end>
<start> tom was arrested on monday . <end>
<start> this book is for you . <end>
<start> i have to think about it . <end>
<start> there s nothing good on television . <end>
<start> rome is famous for its ancient architecture . <end>
<start> let s eat sushi . <end>
<start> have you ever been on tv ? <end>
<start> i believe , beyond a shadow of a doubt , that she is innocent . <end>
<start> mary came up to tom at the party and told him she had a crush on him . <end>
<start> his room s a mess . <end>
<start> i won t leave this house voluntarily . <end>
<start> i want you to go with tom . <end>
<start> come here , and i ll show you . <end>
<start> i can touch the ceiling . <end>
<start> we just have to stick together . <end>
<start> i m sick of talking about it . <end>
<start> you need to know . <end>
<start> he is no ordinary student . <end>
<start> tom fell flat on his face . <end>
<start> i know you don t want to be lonely . <end>
<start> what did you answer ? <end>
<start> tom urged mary to tell john the truth . <end>
<start> tom threw a stone into the pond . <end>
<start> i really appreciate the fact that you like me just the way i am . <end>
<start> she cooks well . <end>
<start> the door locks automatically . <end>
<start> she gets lost really easily . she s got no sense of direction . <end>
<start> what time is your curfew ? <end>
<start> tom asked mary to give him some money . <end>
<start> soldiers must obey their commanders . <end>
<start> i didn t mean to sound so harsh . <end>
<start> tom went to the park . <end>
<start> the tenor sang very well tonight . <end>
<start> i fear this won t end well . <end>
<start> tom has recently become forgetful . <end>
<start> i d like a hotel reservation . <end>
<start> tom didn t say how many times he had been there . <end>
<start> the fire started in tom s room . <end>
<start> she lived there about five years . <end>
<start> she was reading a gardening manual . <end>
<start> she is beautiful , no matter what she wears . <end>
<start> my car won t start . <end>
<start> i m moving . <end>
<start> she bought him a car , but he didn t have a driver s license so he couldn t drive it anywhere . <end>
<start> today was the first time i ever saw tom smile . <end>
<start> will it be much longer ? <end>
<start> tom didn t give up . <end>
<start> questioned about his policies , the candidate gave only vague answers . <end>
<start> the whole town knows about it . <end>
<start> tom put the children to bed . <end>
<start> this is the dumbest idea ever . <end>
<start> i think it s a possibility . <end>
<start> the kettle is boiling . <end>
<start> tom needs a rest . <end>
<start> compare your answer with tom s . <end>
<start> you ve come too early . <end>
<start> she refused my invitation . <end>
<start> do we have time for a cup of coffee ? <end>
<start> i used to often take walks along that river . <end>
<start> five times five is twenty five . <end>
<start> your shoes are untied . <end>
<start> the man you saw in my office yesterday is from belgium . <end>

<start> what did your husband give you for your birthday ? <end>
<start> nobody lives in this house . <end>
<start> he gave me food and money as well . <end>
<start> he must be an honest man . <end>

<start> i just don t want to go with you . <end>
<start> what will you live on while you are there ? <end>
<start> it took me a long time to fall asleep . <end>
<start> i m really starting to hate this town . <end>
<start> i ve had coffee already . <end>
<start> it was very amusing . <end>
<start> a man with a full belly thinks no one is hungry . <end>
<start> that s all i can do for now . <end>
<start> we are inclined to think that most dogs bite . <end>
<start> i can t believe you weren t as impressed as i was . <end>
<start> i wish i had been with her then . <end>
<start> i am undressing . <end>
<start> tom often sits in front of his computer all day . <end>

<start> i want to get in touch with her . <end>
<start> stay focused . <end>
<start> scientists can easily compute the distance between planets . <end>
<start> we re here . <end>
<start> i don t know anybody in boston . <end>
<start> she did not disappoint him . <end>
<start> it s still too hard to find a job . and even if you have a job , chances are you re having a tougher time paying the rising costs of everything from groceries to gas . <end>
<start> we took lots of pictures . <end>
<start> we found a corpse in the ruins . <end>
<start> the squeaking of the door gets on my nerves . <end>
<start> how many computers have you had so far ? <end>
<start> how s everybody at home ? <end>
<start> he has a lot of hobbies . <end>
<start> where are the lifeboats ? <end>
<start> i d like to go there someday . <end>

<start> he pressed me to stay a little longer . <end>
<start> wherever you go , you ll be welcomed . <end>
<start> tell me what you re looking for and i ll help . <end>
<start> i ll sleep on the floor . <end>

<start> tom jumped into the cold water . <end>

<start> you should confer with your attorney on this matter . <end>
<start> such accidents can happen from time to time . <end>
<start> even though he was sick , the boy still went to school . <end>
<start> tom made himself a peanut butter sandwich . <end>
<start> that s what you get for not listening . <end>
<start> we assemble water heaters . <end>
<start> do you want to know what the real problem is ? <end>
<start> it s bad manners to talk during a concert . <end>
<start> theory and practice do not necessarily go together . <end>
<start> don t compare yourself with your brother because he s a better man than you . <end>
<start> tom and mary shared a room . <end>
<start> you were perfect . <end>

<start> i am very sad today . <end>
<start> he was sleeping under the tree . <end>
<start> please give him detailed and specific directions . <end>
<start> i like him . <end>
<start> there is an urgent need for food and water . <end>
<start> he didn t tell the truth . <end>
<start> there are two zombies inside my house . <end>
<start> you have nothing to fear anymore . <end>
<start> i think i can handle it . <end>
<start> he shouted , get out ! <end>
<start> i drank from the tap . <end>
<start> i want to buy that . <end>
<start> everyone is staring at tom . <end>
<start> i prefer to work alone . <end>
<start> i like not only classical music but also jazz . <end>
<start> i want to eat a mango . <end>
<start> she refused his offer . <end>
<start> my brother takes care of our dog . <end>

<start> i m worried about them . <end>
<start> this place is beautiful . <end>
<start> the salary of a teacher is lower than that of a lawyer . <end>
<start> don t leave the bedroom window open . <end>
<start> instead of fewer accidents there are more . <end>
<start> it s a new movie theater . <end>
<start> not everyone is honest . <end>
<start> daddy , i can t walk any more . carry me . <end>
<start> you can use this pen . <end>
<start> come along with us . <end>
<start> the girl is small for her age . <end>
<start> studying three hours a week wouldn t be enough to learn a language well . <end>
<start> bad news travels quickly . <end>
<start> tom doesn t know what mary told john . <end>
<start> why did you come back here if you didn t really want to ? <end>
<start> i m a teacher . <end>
<start> the door blew shut . <end>
<start> it s your turn to shuffle . <end>
<start> i am in no mood for joking . <end>
<start> i heard you got a new car . <end>
<start> tom wants to see his son . <end>
<start> something must be wrong with the machinery . <end>
<start> i don t want to get married too early . <end>
<start> we waited a long time , but she didn t show up . <end>
<start> tom didn t seem surprised when he heard that mary and john had gotten married . <end>
<start> tom took a nap for thirty minutes . <end>
<start> i have everything i ve ever wanted . <end>
<start> how much money does tom need to borrow ? <end>
<start> tom will go first . <end>
<start> i can t believe anyone ate what tom cooked . <end>

<start> if i had had more money , i would have bought the pen . <end>
<start> there is an urgent need for money . <end>
<start> don t tell tom i m here . <end>
<start> can you give me more food ? <end>
<start> i saw him caught by the police . <end>
<start> are you sure you don t want me to talk to tom about that ? <end>
<start> he s stark naked . <end>
<start> i didn t want to alarm you . <end>
<start> tom and mary were seated next to each other in the back seat of john s car . <end>
<start> i missed you a lot . <end>
<start> you have to be very quiet . <end>
<start> get off my lawn . <end>
<start> it was easy to find his office . <end>
<start> he is a golfer . <end>
<start> give me a kiss . <end>
<start> aren t you thirsty ? <end>
<start> i m here every night . <end>
<start> are you wearing that dress for the first time ? <end>
<start> my daughter is going to buy new furniture . <end>
<start> he s the only one who survived . <end>
<start> no matter how much she eats , she never gains weight . <end>
<start> no one can know everything . <end>
<start> i haven t played the ukulele in years . <end>
<start> she doesn t yet know the truth . <end>
<start> it s like a dream . <end>
<start> his hat looked very funny . <end>
<start> we re not family . <end>
<start> i think we should call tom . <end>
<start> he is a handsome man . <end>
<start> tom hasn t done anything to be ashamed of . <end>
<start> what he did wasn t wrong . <end>
<start> look up these words in the dictionary . <end>
<start> this is not a good idea . <end>
<start> what kind of fuel do you use in this machine ? <end>
<start> the holidays are coming . <end>
<start> i can resist everything except temptation . <end>
<start> please give me a cup of milk . <end>
<start> she died of cancer . <end>
<start> i did nothing unlawful . <end>
<start> the competition has become fierce . <end>
<start> i m inviting you . <end>
<start> i m still alive . <end>
<start> tom gave up hope . <end>
<start> he has a keen awareness of the problem . <end>
<start> i m very happy now . <end>
<start> hunger compelled the boy to steal money from the cash register . <end>
<start> please teach me french . <end>
<start> you should carry out your duty . <end>
<start> i would like to thank my parents , tom and mary . <end>
<start> that s his house . <end>
<start> i am allowed to swim in the river . <end>

<start> tom seems to be nervous . <end>
<start> we won the battle . <end>
<start> could you lower your voice please ? i m really hung over . <end>
<start> i thought it was tom , but it was john . <end>
<start> tom has a strange way of talking . <end>
<start> he often walks to school . <end>
<start> this isn t the last train , is it ? <end>
<start> plans for a new trade zone are still on the drawing board . <end>
<start> is it a boy or a girl ? <end>
<start> it was like a dream . <end>
<start> the zipper is stuck . <end>
<start> i can t get the car to start . <end>
<start> when did she leave the classroom ? <end>
<start> how long do you think it will take to go to the airport ? <end>
<start> the ball hit the fence . <end>
<start> tom sent me a present . <end>
<start> tom is winning . <end>
<start> you re so immature . <end>
<start> over     tons of dust and sand sized particles bombard the earth every day from space , most of which goes unnoticed . <end>
<start> tom is a personal friend . <end>
<start> tom is incapable of doing that . <end>
<start> mary isn t my girlfriend anymore . <end>
<start> the king got undressed . <end>
<start> i was told that you could teach me how to sharpen a knife . <end>
<start> the can is empty . <end>

<start> i noticed that you were staring at me . <end>
<start> i met her in london for the first time . <end>
<start> you re right . <end>
<start> the problem was very difficult . <end>
<start> the king s son was kidnapped . <end>
<start> leaky faucets waste a lot of water . <end>
<start> he bowed to me as he left the room . <end>
<start> dinner s ready . <end>
<start> my life is complete . <end>
<start> just take your pick . <end>
<start> let s go back . <end>
<start> i could feel nothing but the knife as it plunged into my back . <end>
<start> ask tom to come tomorrow . <end>
<start> he described exactly what happened . <end>
<start> i don t know what that word means , but i ll try to find out . <end>
<start> what country are you from ? <end>
<start> i own an electric guitar . <end>
<start> it is easy to play tennis . <end>
<start> what are these ? <end>
<start> you should buy her a gift card instead . <end>
<start> tom refused to follow mary s advice . <end>
<start> the doll was surprisingly lifelike . <end>
<start> tom is an honest boy , so he doesn t lie . <end>
<start> don t waste your youth , otherwise you ll regret it later . <end>
<start> i like to play poker . <end>

<start> the sun is shining . <end>
<start> i saw his face in the dim light . <end>
<start> i didn t know you had a brother . <end>
<start> stop here . <end>
<start> tom tried to rescue mary . <end>
<start> why did you join the army ? <end>
<start> we reached the station on time . <end>
<start> i want tom to tell me what he meant by that . <end>
<start> where is the japanese embassy ? <end>
<start> she made the doll for me . <end>
<start> it wasn t the first time and it won t be the last . <end>
<start> the only one who enjoys a crowded subway car is a pickpocket . <end>
<start> the door could not be opened . <end>

<start> russia is facing great financial difficulties . <end>
<start> i hope something bad doesn t happen to us . <end>
<start> i can t forgive her . <end>

<start> he always insists on having everything his own way . <end>
<start> i d like to study in china to improve the level of my chinese . <end>
<start> i m too busy to help him . <end>
<start> tom came home early yesterday . <end>

<start> i had intended to visit you yesterday . <end>
<start> what kind of music does tom like ? <end>
<start> i hope your wishes will come true . <end>
<start> tom doesn t do drugs . <end>
<start> the warehouse was a front for drug traffickers . <end>
<start> tom asked mary why john was so unhappy . <end>
<start> unbelievable ! <end>
<start> after killing tom , mary escaped through the window . <end>
<start> kiss tom . <end>
<start> the argument quickly got out of control . <end>
<start> most people know that sea water is undrinkable . <end>
<start> give me a little ice cream . <end>
<start> live and learn . <end>
<start> we ll wait . <end>
<start> he shot a tiger through the head . <end>
<start> there is nothing scarier than death . <end>
<start> i just got a promotion . <end>
<start> tom hasn t been to the supermarket in a long time . <end>
<start> i ve had a busy morning . <end>
<start> what does she look like ? <end>
<start> you must be careful when talking to a european . <end>
<start> i am right handed . <end>
<start> those shoes won t do for climbing . <end>
<start> we were ordered away without any explanation . <end>
<start> this ought to help . <end>
<start> he said that he had a lot of money . <end>
<start> i ve got to keep going . <end>
<start> tom asked for a receipt . <end>
<start> can you answer this question ? <end>
<start> tom received a letter from mary this morning . <end>
<start> you must be more patient . <end>
<start> tom sold his house in boston . <end>
<start> have you seen them ? <end>
<start> she smiled and accepted my little present . <end>
<start> you should prepare for tomorrow s lessons . <end>
<start> you seem busy . <end>
<start> she never discusses that . <end>
<start> that cheese is made from sheep s milk . <end>
<start> you never let me do anything . <end>
<start> tom might be able to do that , but i doubt it . <end>
<start> we sometimes meet them . <end>

<start> we met at two in the afternoon . <end>
<start> i can resist everything but temptation . <end>
<start> welcome to the united states . <end>

<start> there were two lines of soldiers . <end>
<start> without your help , i would have drowned . <end>
<start> don t raise your voice above a whisper . <end>
<start> that is a good idea . <end>
<start> does anyone in your family speak french ? <end>

<start> he is probably busy . <end>
<start> she gradually began to understand . <end>
<start> they all talked . <end>
<start> there is a path through the fields . <end>
<start> mary is a rebellious girl . <end>
<start> are you saying my life is in danger ? <end>
<start> he is as poor as can be . <end>
<start> i must have made a mistake . <end>
<start> my investments earn about    percent a year . <end>
<start> tom , mary and john shared the cost of the party . <end>
<start> the jury acquitted him of the crime . <end>
<start> tom is obviously in love with mary . <end>
<start> i m a lonely man . <end>
<start> let s listen to music . <end>
<start> my knee is bleeding . <end>
<start> don t talk to me while i m working . <end>

<start> i showed him who s boss . <end>
<start> i took my shoes off . <end>
<start> i can eat it in here . <end>
<start> she always believes me . <end>
<start> he may have missed the plane . <end>
<start> i don t know anything about japan . <end>
<start> if what you say is true , it follows that he has an alibi . <end>
<start> you can t keep me from doing that . <end>
<start> tom needs mary . <end>
<start> do you know how to start a fire using just sticks of wood ? <end>
<start> now what s the deal ? <end>

<start> tom and mary finally decided to get married . <end>
<start> don t lie to us . <end>
<start> i can t explain it either . <end>
<start> she pulled him out of the mud . <end>

<start> i wouldn t be so sure . <end>
<start> you can use that phone . <end>
<start> i love winning . <end>
<start> when did you come ? <end>
<start> is the cat on the chair or under the chair ? <end>
<start> i was half asleep when i went home . <end>
<start> you are very fortunate that you have such friends . <end>
<start> i am looking for a present for my mother . <end>
<start> tom can run fast . <end>
<start> my apartment is not far from here . <end>
<start> the suspect confessed . <end>
<start> a lot of people think that lawyers get paid too much . <end>
<start> who is this girl ? <end>
<start> i didn t call you stupid . <end>
<start> the board is about two meters long . <end>

<start> what s in here ? <end>
<start> you should obey the traffic laws when you drive . <end>
<start> i m just living from day to day . <end>

<start> is it my turn ? <end>
<start> they re looking for you . <end>
<start> her father is japanese . <end>
<start> i bought    pencils . <end>
<start> i don t like this game . <end>
<start> it takes a lot of time to get used to married life . <end>
<start> she gets along well with him . <end>
<start> i can t believe tom left without saying goodbye . <end>
<start> tom made mary stand up . <end>
<start> help me stand up . <end>
<start> she doesn t like living downtown . <end>
<start> cats can see in the dark . <end>
<start> i don t know what she s trying to say . <end>
<start> this book is too expensive for me . <end>
<start> fill the tires with air . <end>
<start> i ll be with you in five minutes . <end>

<start> i d like to see you . <end>
<start> everyone loves him . <end>
<start> which foreign language are you learning ? <end>

<start> tom was just being polite . <end>
<start> who s first ? <end>
<start> i need to use your phone to call an ambulance . <end>
<start> i think i know where tom is . <end>
<start> do you want to get married ? <end>
<start> the tea set isn t complete . <end>
<start> i think he is a doctor . <end>
<start> tom hurt my feelings . <end>
<start> tom is trying to say something . <end>
<start> hello there , what s new ? <end>
<start> to my dismay i found i had lost my money . <end>
<start> i don t have enough money . <end>
<start> i d like to see the menu . <end>
<start> the audience applauded the actress . <end>
<start> the tooth fairy teaches children that they can sell body parts for money . <end>
<start> tom certainly wouldn t be pleased if mary went out on a date with john . <end>
<start> nobody volunteers . <end>
<start> what made you do a silly thing like that ? <end>
<start> your advice has always been very helpful to me . <end>
<start> everybody wanted one . <end>
<start> he s in the other truck . <end>
<start> it really doesn t concern you . <end>
<start> i bet that s pretty easy to do . <end>
<start> you re an unreliable witness . <end>
<start> is he still there ? <end>
<start> the impact of science on society is great . <end>
<start> i can get someone to cover for me . <end>
<start> may i go home ? <end>
<start> tom is proud of his good grades . <end>
<start> here , try this . <end>
<start> they smiled at each other . <end>
<start> tell me what that man is like . <end>
<start> we should remain quiet . <end>
<start> we re cousins . <end>
<start> i had nothing to do with that incident . <end>
<start> he was charged with conspiracy . <end>
<start> i don t think tom can deal with the situation . <end>
<start> i was in the hospital a few days ago . <end>
<start> where is the entrance to the museum ? <end>
<start> he survived an accident last year , but still drives recklessly . <end>
<start> she bowed to me politely . <end>
<start> can i borrow it for about two weeks ? <end>
<start> i hope this horse doesn t kick . <end>
<start> they left before we arrived . <end>
<start> i ll be home alone all night . <end>
<start> i didn t think of that . <end>
<start> the two streets run parallel to one another . <end>
<start> this is a dog . <end>
<start> tom doesn t know anything about boston . <end>
<start> he was impatient to see his son . <end>
<start> could you help me for ten minutes ? <end>
<start> i can t believe you re going to give away all your money . <end>
<start> meat , please . <end>
<start> i have borrowed a car . <end>
<start> you re not sick . <end>
<start> she decided not to go . <end>
<start> god bless you ! <end>
<start> don t lose heart . <end>
<start> i can t think about anything else . <end>
<start> do you like music ? <end>
<start> i ll send flowers . <end>
<start> please leave everything to me . <end>
<start> tom could be disguised . <end>
<start> if i were you , i would stay quiet . <end>
<start> that movie was shown on tv . <end>
<start> i m coming home . <end>
<start> tom s response was immediate . <end>
<start> has he paid back the money you lent him ? <end>
<start> tom wants to be your friend . <end>
<start> tom bought flowers . <end>
<start> i ll protect tom . <end>
<start> the dog was sleeping on the mat . <end>
<start> the dog came running to us . <end>
<start> he is a very smart boy . <end>
<start> we can talk . <end>
<start> your work didn t come up to our expectations . <end>
<start> the text represents the thoughts and the feelings of the author . <end>
<start> because of the poor harvest , wheat prices have gone up in the last six months . <end>
<start> why did you do it ? <end>
<start> tom , i want you to come with me . <end>
<start> you should have attended the meeting in person . <end>
<start> he sold his own car without hesitation . <end>
<start> the only fish tom likes to eat is salmon . <end>
<start> tom isn t as good at french as he thinks he is . <end>
<start> tom and i have big plans . <end>
<start> i haven t yet read all of these books . <end>
<start> i read a lot of novels . <end>
<start> the workmen were climbing up and down the ladder . <end>
<start> tom heard that mary had died . <end>
<start> i don t know why you re all so angry . <end>
<start> they don t like you . <end>
<start> i wish i could spend more time with you . <end>
<start> the trouble is that you are too young . <end>
<start> spring has come . <end>
<start> playing cards is a popular pastime . <end>
<start> see you soon ! <end>
<start> he fell in love with a younger woman . <end>
<start> i asked him where i could park my car . <end>
<start> i knew this moment would come . <end>
<start> you re very pretty . <end>
<start> i can not put up with his insults any longer . <end>
<start> tom hardly ever asks questions . <end>
<start> our friendship did not last . <end>
<start> i think it s time for me to go . <end>
<start> i admit it won t be easy . <end>
<start> this medicine will decrease your pain . <end>
<start> are you through with the phone ? <end>
<start> i prefer biking . <end>
<start> i am not studying now . <end>
<start> the lake is big . <end>
<start> don t tell me to relax . <end>
<start> the dog is panting . <end>
<start> have you taken your temperature ? <end>
<start> i learned nothing from the teacher . <end>
<start> the kid has a keen sense of hearing . <end>
<start> i thought i was going to die last night . <end>
<start> this is not important . <end>
<start> is it far from here ? <end>
<start> even a child can understand it . <end>
<start> tom died on monday . <end>
<start> this work is by no means easy . <end>
<start> i wish i could figure out how to stop my children from fighting . <end>
<start> we don t get on well with each other . <end>
<start> why didn t you call me up ? <end>
<start> he never fails to call his mother on her birthday . <end>
<start> they visit us from time to time . <end>
<start> this conversation is a masterpiece . <end>
<start> how do we know we can trust tom ? <end>
<start> i d like some time alone , please . <end>
<start> we ve got trouble . <end>
<start> tom didn t come to school yesterday . <end>
<start> he is an eager beaver . <end>
<start> tom has a beard just like his father , grandfathers and brothers do . <end>
<start> you really must stop smoking . <end>
<start> i ll give you a piece of good advice . <end>
<start> tom did a pretty good job . <end>
<start> it s important to have an off site backup of all the data on your computer . <end>
<start> i was talking about clothes . <end>
<start> he was seized with fear . <end>
<start> there used to be a statue of a lion at the gate . <end>
<start> he knows how to teach languages . <end>
<start> do you want me to stay or don t you ? <end>
<start> i jog in the morning . <end>
<start> mind your own business . <end>
<start> i m starting to get used to living here . <end>
<start> how much is a meter of this red silk ? <end>
<start> sorry , but your brother is an idiot . <end>
<start> in my family , the punishment for lying was severe . <end>
<start> tom is the youngest child in his family . <end>
<start> you are making history . <end>
<start> i ll allow this . <end>
<start> tom stood there for a while . <end>
<start> i am fond of reading . <end>
<start> he cut off two meters of the rope . <end>
<start> how old do you think i am ? <end>
<start> when did you get up ? <end>
<start> i used to think it didn t really matter what i fed my dog . <end>
<start> the short circuit blew a fuse . <end>
<start> i don t want to lose tom . <end>
<start> next time it will be my turn to drive . <end>
<start> tom burned himself on the stove . <end>
<start> i had the boy carry my bag . <end>
<start> i can walk no farther . <end>
<start> that is her car . <end>
<start> will she go to america next year ? <end>
<start> this watch is far better than that one . <end>
<start> what did you say ? <end>
<start> she sat next to me . <end>
<start> the noise is getting louder and louder . <end>
<start> my dad will kill me . <end>
<start> the bus stopped and tom got off . <end>
<start> there s something i want you to hear . <end>
<start> mary was wearing a black sweater when i met her . <end>
<start> you can always count on me . <end>
<start> tom doesn t usually do stupid things like that . <end>
<start> move on , tom . <end>
<start> when do i get paid ? <end>
<start> i d like to say a few words . <end>
<start> i was astonished . <end>
<start> take all the time you need . <end>
<start> i ve never liked tom . <end>
<start> what s your blood type ? <end>
<start> i live in a rural area . <end>
<start> there must be more . <end>
<start> what time do you want to meet ? <end>
<start> i just want to ask you a few questions . <end>
<start> she speaks both english and french . <end>
<start> a man touched down on the moon . a wall came down in berlin . a world was connected by our own science and imagination . <end>
<start> i thought tom and mary were going to kill john . <end>
<start> she couldn t convince him to give a speech . <end>
<start> i ve discovered a serious error . <end>
<start> it is evident that he did it . <end>
<start> i am learning to speak filipino . <end>
<start> a housewife has many domestic duties . <end>
<start> let me give this to you before i forget . <end>
<start> what s your favorite tongue twister ? <end>
<start> have you ever caught a fish ? <end>
<start> she turned around quickly . <end>
<start> you ve got nothing to worry about from me . <end>
<start> may i ask you something ? <end>
<start> by the way , where do you live ? <end>
<start> tom can t stand up . <end>
<start> i am seeing my uncle tomorrow . <end>
<start> they meant well . <end>
<start> she s a wonderful wife and mother . <end>
<start> tom let mary go . <end>
<start> i ll drive you to the airport . <end>
<start> she reluctantly went by herself . <end>
<start> do the trains run on diesel oil ? <end>
<start> what happens to all the wood ? <end>
<start> not all children like apples . <end>
<start> tom lives on the other side of boston . <end>
<start> this piano has probably not been tuned for years . <end>
<start> he s attracted to asian girls . <end>
<start> you re hiding something . <end>
<start> it would be romantic . <end>
<start> he likes his school a lot . <end>
<start> the meeting took place last week . <end>
<start> tom needs us . <end>
<start> the dogs belong to her . <end>
<start> it was difficult to persuade him to change his mind . <end>
<start> the climate here is like that of hokkaido . <end>
<start> when was the last time you crossed a river ? <end>
<start> lend me something with which to cut the string . <end>
<start> she and i usually have the same opinion . <end>
<start> squeeze the trigger . <end>
<start> i was in the area . <end>
<start> i plan to spend all day with tom . <end>
<start> that s not what you said before . <end>
<start> read your statement before you sign it . <end>
<start> judging from the expression on her face , she is worried . <end>
<start> i don t want to be rude . <end>
<start> i ve never seen such a scatterbrain . <end>
<start> this flower is more beautiful than that one . <end>
<start> why should i learn french ? <end>
<start> i think that he is honest . <end>
<start> the old house was demolished . <end>
<start> i have so many clothes i don t know what to wear tomorrow . <end>
<start> tom doesn t know the half of it . <end>
<start> good luck with the new job . <end>
<start> my tv has quit working . <end>
<start> we wanted to do it right away . <end>
<start> when we were kids , we played together every day . <end>
<start> tom doesn t get along with his neighbors like he used to . <end>
<start> we must learn to live in harmony with nature . <end>
<start> my work is finished . <end>
<start> apples grow on trees . <end>
<start> tom misled you . <end>
<start> yesterday i was told i looked like kohei tanaka . <end>
<start> the ship passed through the panama canal . <end>
<start> they need help to understand their office equipment . <end>
<start> i wonder where he is now . <end>
<start> please bring the master key . <end>
<start> they re coming back . <end>
<start> tell me who you plan to go to boston with . <end>
<start> i need some time alone . <end>
<start> don t trust him . <end>
<start> i went back to my seat . <end>
<start> speak more slowly . <end>
<start> let s try something . <end>
<start> three beers and a tequila please . <end>
<start> i asked him if i could read his book . <end>
<start> i still don t trust tom very much . <end>
<start> someday we will be able to go on a voyage to mars . <end>
<start> i should have said something . <end>
<start> my dad goes out for a walk every morning . <end>
<start> we need to find a good place to hide . <end>
<start> he bought a lot of flour and oil . <end>
<start> i feel like i ve become someone else . <end>
<start> he bores everybody . <end>
<start> they can t see me . <end>
<start> i used to play the trombone . <end>
<start> i do the laundry on sundays . <end>
<start> your name was mentioned . <end>
<start> it doesn t matter where he comes from . <end>
<start> she was bewitched by his smile . <end>
<start> pizza is my favorite food . <end>
<start> have you been told where to park your car ? <end>
<start> did you see how big their house is ? <end>
<start> i am from the netherlands . <end>
<start> his bag was stolen yesterday . <end>
<start> there s no way that tom could have stolen the money without being seen . <end>
<start> i thought i heard you . <end>
<start> it s a simple job . <end>
<start> i m faster than you . <end>
<start> i told tom it was a mistake . <end>
<start> he speaks russian perfectly . <end>
<start> the war had united the american people . <end>
<start> we laughed and laughed . <end>
<start> i don t remember seeing you before . <end>
<start> thank you for attending this meeting . <end>
<start> where are the toilets ? <end>
<start> i went to see the baseball game yesterday . <end>
<start> i m tired . i ve got to go now . <end>
<start> tell tom hi for me . <end>
<start> i am forever in your debt . <end>
<start> tom gained weight over the winter . <end>
<start> would you like me to help you with your homework ? <end>
<start> our army broke through the enemy defenses . <end>
<start> i like winter better than summer . <end>
<start> are you sure this is a good idea ? <end>
<start> i have no idea who tom is . <end>
<start> excuse me . where are the eggs ? <end>
<start> tom s not happy with that . <end>
<start> my brother didn t have the courage to swim across the river . <end>
<start> i really don t understand what s up with her . <end>
<start> mary is tom s stepmother . <end>
<start> give me another cup of tea . <end>
<start> she was looking forward to spending time with him . <end>
<start> please tell me the secret to making good jam . <end>
<start> tom works for a translation agency . <end>
<start> she was in the americas last month . <end>
<start> tom respects mary . <end>
<start> why don t you come to my house and play the piano ? <end>
<start> he s crazy about you . <end>
<start> the population of australia is much smaller than that of japan . <end>
<start> will he live ? <end>
<start> tom ate the three apples in less than five minutes . <end>
<start> trains come more often than buses . <end>
<start> she complained to him about everything . <end>
<start> is this your opinion ? <end>
<start> we ll talk about that later . <end>
<start> he shaves four times a week . <end>
<start> tom and i help each other . <end>
<start> i had a cup of coffee at the cafe . <end>
<start> tom didn t expect to hear mary s voice . <end>
<start> it is difficult to walk    kilometers a day . <end>
<start> jorge can speak four languages . <end>
<start> you will all die . <end>
<start> there is a big hole in your stocking . <end>
<start> he was taken care of by a certain young doctor . <end>
<start> tom always drinks at least three cups of coffee in the morning . <end>
<start> she didn t think so . <end>
<start> i saw that he came . <end>
<start> mother in law jokes are funny because they re true . <end>
<start> i m busy at the moment . <end>
<start> i believe that he s trustworthy . <end>
<start> the pirates had no choice but to surrender . <end>
<start> that s what you don t understand . <end>
<start> tom hid mary s doll behind the door . <end>
<start> warm and humid weather increases the number of crimes . <end>
<start> tom is hardworking and dependable . <end>
<start> i m japanese , the boy answered . <end>
<start> why are you holding my hands ? <end>
<start> i didn t want that job . <end>
<start> tom hacked mary s leg off with a rusty machete . <end>
<start> what is this thing called ? <end>
<start> where are you from ? <end>
<start> the windows are open . <end>
<start> he gave me back the money . <end>
<start> will you help me with this ? <end>
<start> the enemy attack ceased at dawn . <end>
<start> i didn t do it on purpose . <end>
<start> in my opinion , german is the best language in the world . <end>
<start> i recommend maui . <end>
<start> he is prisoner , but he is innocent . <end>
<start> she laid her baby on the bed . <end>
<start> he likes to play cards . <end>
<start> you can t teach an old dog new tricks . <end>
<start> i really don t understand what you re saying to me . <end>
<start> we ll eat lunch on the bus . <end>
<start> she was watching the dead leaves fall . <end>
<start> i prefer spring to autumn . <end>
<start> we have to be patient . <end>
<start> the sun doesn t shine at night . <end>
<start> why is tom wet ? <end>
<start> i can t go back with them . <end>
<start> neither tom nor mary had a job . <end>
<start> tom didn t feel very confident . <end>
<start> our plane is flying over the clouds . <end>
<start> how dare you speak like that ? <end>
<start> i was no match for tom . <end>
<start> the two men fought for a long time . <end>
<start> tom leaped from his seat . <end>
<start> he s collecting various data . <end>
<start> who can it possibly be ? <end>
<start> the apples that he sent to me were delicious . <end>
<start> what s your favorite board game ? <end>
<start> that s why i told you not to go by car . <end>
<start> don t forget to close the door . <end>
<start> a bird can fly . <end>
<start> it happened that she and i liked the same kind of music . <end>
<start> that a boy ! <end>

<start> i d appreciate it if you d turn off the lights . <end>
<start> tom had something important to say , but mary kept interrupting him . <end>
<start> i was looking for a hotel , when i saw you . <end>
<start> tom threatened us . <end>
<start> our teacher told us what to read . <end>
<start> the soldier was wounded in the leg . <end>

<start> everybody agreed with his idea . <end>
<start> tom didn t win . <end>
<start> tom s friends laughed at him . <end>
<start> it s true ! <end>
<start> culture is like jam , the less you have , the more you spread it . <end>
<start> this is a daily newspaper . <end>
<start> it was a warm summer evening . <end>
<start> now is the time when we need him most . <end>
<start> my brother bought an electric guitar . <end>
<start> go brush your teeth . <end>
<start> there were many snow storms last winter . <end>
<start> why haven t you called ? <end>
<start> this book is too expensive . <end>
<start> i want everyone to know that i m not a murderer . <end>
<start> we left him some cake . <end>
<start> i ll drop you off at the station . <end>
<start> i heard him coming downstairs . <end>

<start> i don t want to start anything i can t finish . <end>
<start> my nose itches . <end>

<start> the family had a hard time after the war . <end>
<start> there s nothing to it . <end>
<start> i want to see my brother . <end>
<start> a white haired man was playing an accordion outside the shop . <end>
<start> that photographer is really talented . <end>
<start> because he was tired , he went to bed early . <end>
<start> many of these are mine . <end>
<start> i insisted that we change our original plan . <end>
<start> i received an invitation to the birthday party . <end>
<start> tom certainly looked and sounded better than he did last month when we visited him . <end>
<start> i walked around in the field . <end>
<start> he consented to help the old lady . <end>
<start> whose notebook is that ? <end>
<start> was tom here when it happened ? <end>
<start> wash everything . <end>
<start> may i help you ? no , thank you . i m just looking . <end>
<start> they are running now . <end>
<start> i m probably the only person who can help you do that . <end>
<start> maybe tom would be willing to help . <end>
<start> now step back . <end>
<start> he lives in the western part of town . <end>
<start> my father was lost in thought . <end>
<start> tom must be canadian . <end>
<start> tom is naive , isn t he ? <end>
<start> why is tom not here ? <end>
<start> what are you thinking ? <end>
<start> has tom told mary that he can t speak french at all ? <end>
<start> she went to see him in the hospital every day . <end>
<start> i didn t criticize him . <end>
<start> frankly speaking , his speeches are always dull . <end>
<start> she spends a lot of money on clothes . <end>
<start> whoever wants to come will be welcomed . <end>
<start> that just goes to prove that you are a liar . <end>
<start> when i was your age , i bicycled to and from school every day . <end>
<start> i feed my dog twice a day . <end>
<start> she thinks money and happiness are the same . <end>
<start> my wife loves apple pie . <end>
<start> that s what tom told me . <end>
<start> i also went there . <end>
<start> he is busy with his work . <end>
<start> i d like to sit by the window . <end>
<start> i ve got one like that already . <end>
<start> do you want me to explain it again ? <end>
<start> she s a very good teacher . <end>
<start> he studied abroad . <end>
<start> that s tom s office . <end>
<start> tom has many cats . <end>
<start> there s nothing worse than loneliness . <end>
<start> i have a new email address . <end>
<start> make yourself at home . <end>
<start> does anyone else have any suggestions ? <end>
<start> he was buried alive . <end>
<start> his eyes rested on the girl . <end>
<start> does mary really love me ? <end>
<start> i asked my mother to wake me up at four . <end>
<start> he scolded her . <end>
<start> i don t like the taste of onions . <end>
<start> the girl wore a yellow ribbon in her hair . <end>
<start> there was a little milk left in the bottle . <end>
<start> i wish i were as smart as you . <end>
<start> i m so tired that i can t walk any longer . <end>
<start> your chair is identical to mine . <end>
<start> she rejected my proposal . <end>
<start> why can t we just take a cab ? <end>
<start> it s too complicated . <end>
<start> there are many factors . <end>
<start> do you have a shoe box where i can put these things ? <end>
<start> call me once you ve arrived . <end>
<start> i didn t tell them . <end>
<start> tom had no money to pay for a cab . <end>
<start> we took a plane from tokyo to sapporo . <end>
<start> i don t know what it means . <end>
<start> i told you tom wouldn t let us down . <end>
<start> he does it fast . <end>
<start> don t ever forget it . <end>
<start> i still think it s unlikely that we ll find any evidence to prove tom s guilt . <end>
<start> you ve certainly been busy . <end>
<start> didn t you know that oil floats on water ? <end>
<start> the call is free of charge . <end>
<start> i m not accustomed to getting up so early . <end>
<start> tom would never hit mary . <end>
<start> why does this always happen to me ? <end>
<start> where would you like to sit ? <end>
<start> i want to share something with you . <end>
<start> you re joking , aren t you ? <end>
<start> tom may not want to do that . <end>
<start> i want to spend time with you . <end>
<start> if you want to do that , i m not going to try and stop you . <end>
<start> the two towns are separated by a river . <end>
<start> tom thought he was going to enjoy the party . <end>
<start> i had my wallet stolen . <end>
<start> my aunt brought up five children . <end>
<start> my little brother is watching tv . <end>
<start> i need paint . <end>

<start> i m at my parents  place . <end>
<start> he generally goes home at five o clock . <end>
<start> this shirt needs to be ironed . <end>
<start> i m used to it . <end>
<start> there was another problem . <end>
<start> why did tom come back ? <end>
<start> the doctor s office is on the second floor . <end>
<start> what is this notebook for ? <end>
<start> why do bees die after stinging ? <end>
<start> last year , i decided to come to japan . <end>
<start> thousands of men were on their way to washington . <end>
<start> he doesn t need to get up so early . <end>
<start> i told you not to call me at work . <end>
<start> elephants are in danger of dying out . <end>
<start> tom understands what it takes to succeed . <end>
<start> he taught a group of indian boys . <end>
<start> tom used to eat a lot of junk food . <end>
<start> she looked at me and smiled . <end>
<start> i hate math most of all . <end>
<start> is this a different word or just another form of the same word ? <end>
<start> it may seem odd . <end>
<start> when you watch television or listen to the radio , the music which you hear is often african in origin . <end>

<start> it s a very pressing matter . <end>
<start> you need money . <end>
<start> i m    , too . <end>
<start> tell me what tom said . <end>
<start> annoying people irritate me . <end>
<start> it s a cloudy day . <end>
<start> he is almost always at home . <end>
<start> i need time to mull things over before i decide what to do . <end>
<start> can i have it ? <end>
<start> they left . <end>
<start> i don t want tom to go to jail . <end>

<start> she picked flowers in the garden . <end>
<start> tom can t help you . <end>
<start> hurry up , and you will be able to catch the train . <end>
<start> she bought him a car . <end>
<start> it s an insult . <end>

<start> he lost control of his legs . <end>
<start> please use a pencil to write down your name . <end>
<start> she still loves him . <end>

<start> the comparison is apt . <end>
<start> they dream of the day when they ll be rolling in money . <end>
<start> these are our books . <end>
<start> it s a pity that you couldn t come . <end>
<start> she doesn t hate him . in fact , she loves him . <end>

<start> i have just what you need . <end>
<start> i went to tom s apartment . <end>
<start> nothing much is happening . <end>
<start> that s too bad . <end>

<start> tom forgot where he left his umbrella . <end>
<start> i won t stop you . <end>

<start> we made statues out of wood . <end>
<start> i watch tv after i finish my homework . <end>

<start> our fate depends on your decisions . <end>
<start> where do i get the subway ? <end>
<start> in her opinion , he is the best musician she has ever seen . <end>
<start> i moved here yesterday . <end>
<start> the difference between the right word and almost the right word is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug . <end>
<start> he went as far as to call you a hypocrite . <end>
<start> tom helped mary wash the dishes . <end>
<start> no matter how rich a man is , he cannot buy love . <end>
<start> tom attended mary s funeral . <end>

<start> the trip was very expensive . <end>
<start> i m jittery . <end>

<start> my doctor advised me to give up smoking . <end>
<start> tom denied knowing anything about it . <end>
<start> i m going to boston for the holidays . <end>
<start> that s hard to say . <end>
<start> i was just thinking about you . <end>
<start> nobody was tortured . <end>
<start> i am not deaf . <end>
<start> he sat in front of me . <end>
<start> i don t know exactly where i am . <end>
<start> if you want to study in the united states , you need to get a student visa . <end>
<start> judging from his appearance , he may be a soldier . <end>
<start> you have to come . <end>

<start> tom lit his cigar . <end>
<start> why did he quit smoking ? <end>
<start> i wish i had a house of my own . <end>
<start> tom runs faster than me . <end>
<start> he made his way through the crowd . <end>
<start> it s a simple job . <end>
<start> that s good to know . <end>
<start> i demand a refund . <end>
<start> what did you learn at school today ? <end>
<start> tom remained unmarried all his life . <end>
<start> the question is who caused the accident . <end>
<start> don t let the children monopolize the television . <end>
<start> the exhibition will be open for another month . <end>

<start> he refused to shake hands . <end>
<start> tom s dog is brown . <end>
<start> tom is on a low fat , high protein diet . <end>

<start> tom looked around the room for his keys . <end>
<start> it s really not that hot . <end>
<start> let s just say that i wasn t surprised . <end>
<start> i have two foreign friends . <end>
<start> seemingly impossible things sometimes happen . <end>

<start> it is our destiny . <end>
<start> i like to chew tobacco . <end>
<start> tom opened the door to the interrogation room . <end>
<start> unfortunately , tom refused to help us . <end>
<start> she is going to have a baby this month . <end>
<start> i m so excited . <end>
<start> tom doesn t pay much attention to how he dresses . <end>
<start> you should get up early . <end>
<start> it is very hot in this room , isn t it ? <end>
<start> maybe i am unhappy , but i don t intend to kill myself . <end>
<start> he is not as intelligent as his older brother . <end>
<start> do you believe in miracles ? <end>
<start> i hate dancing . <end>

<start> i hope you aren t alone . <end>
<start> tom has been trying to learn how to juggle . <end>
<start> are you sure you haven t forgotten anything ? <end>
<start> close the window before going to sleep . <end>
<start> a relationship based on total honesty is bound to fail . <end>
<start> she seems to have found a boyfriend . <end>
<start> this house is mine . <end>
<start> i beg you to forgive me . <end>
<start> don t you have something to do ? <end>
<start> i applied to be an attendant at the exposition . <end>
<start> he must have left . <end>

<start> don t worry . tom won t let us down . <end>
<start> it has been confirmed . <end>
<start> we went along a narrow road . <end>
<start> tom wouldn t blame you . <end>
<start> you ve got my goggles . <end>
<start> there s something missing . <end>
<start> tom needs the money right away . <end>

<start> you tore your pants . <end>
<start> the cover doesn t fit well . <end>
<start> i can t tell you the truth . <end>
<start> what is your problem ? <end>
<start> the cows were moving very slowly through the long green grass . <end>

<start> he is not ashamed of being poor . <end>
<start> tom insists on eating fruit every day . <end>
<start> i kind of miss tom . <end>
<start> he is my type ! <end>
<start> his plan was discarded . <end>
<start> do you want to eat ? <end>
<start> she baked bread and cakes in the oven . <end>
<start> i can t believe that you aren t at least willing to consider the possibility that there s another explanation . <end>
<start> they re ugly . <end>
<start> i can only tell you what i know . <end>
<start> this book was new . <end>
<start> i said a very foolish thing . <end>
<start> how did you kill the guards ? <end>
<start> this is so amazing . <end>
<start> we have no time . <end>
<start> our water heater is leaking . <end>
<start> i can t give this dictionary to anyone . <end>
<start> our teacher sometimes speaks too fast . <end>
<start> tom has a rare disease . <end>
<start> he was wounded in the head . <end>

<start> they live on third avenue . <end>
<start> it is finally all over . <end>

<start> she got up and left in the middle of our conversation . <end>
<start> tom felt happy . <end>
<start> you re the only one who knows how to get to tom s house . <end>
<start> the wheels got all muddy . <end>
<start> you can t help them . <end>
<start> it s on the house . <end>
<start> he s greedy and lazy . <end>
<start> you get what you pay for . <end>
<start> i was fined for not wearing a seatbelt . <end>
<start> do you know anything about training dogs ? <end>
<start> this building looks very futuristic . <end>
<start> what exactly am i paying for ? <end>
<start> my father is going bald . <end>

<start> don t play with fire . <end>
<start> i have a job to finish . <end>

<start> a boy like tom doesn t deserve a girl like mary . <end>

<start> tom listened attentively . <end>

<start> i ll leave that decision to you . <end>
<start> the lion is the king of the beasts . <end>
<start> she called for help . <end>
<start> tom stared into the impenetrable blackness of the night sky . <end>
<start> tom looks like a girl . <end>
<start> tom and mary gave exactly the same answers on the test which made the teacher suspicious . <end>
<start> everyone seems to be short of money these days . <end>
<start> i eat lunch every day at noon . <end>
<start> he followed the doctor s suggestions . <end>

<start> someone is calling for help . <end>
<start> they were lying on the grass . <end>
<start> she fled for fear of being caught . <end>
<start> tom is asleep in his chair . <end>
<start> let s not waste this chance . <end>
<start> parents are always worried about the future of their children . <end>
<start> i need someone to understand me . <end>
<start> tom wondered when mary would arrive . <end>
<start> tom is very selfish , isn t he ? <end>
<start> the jury is hung . <end>
<start> water freezes at   degrees centigrade . <end>
<start> i really need to hit somebody . <end>
<start> a happy new year ! i wish you the same ! <end>

<start> i caught the flu . <end>
<start> tom agreed to help mary with her work . <end>
<start> tv s boring today . <end>
<start> he is very good looking . <end>
<start> a cat appeared from under the desk . <end>
<start> the prophecy came to pass . <end>
<start> tom was accused of doing sloppy work . <end>
<start> one year has twelve months . <end>
<start> why do you want to become a nurse ? <end>
<start> he solved the problem with ease . <end>
<start> the prime minister will hold a press conference tomorrow . <end>
<start> he has a large truck . <end>
<start> my new pair of shoes are made of leather . <end>
<start> where did you put my keys ? <end>
<start> tom apologized for not doing what he had promised he d do . <end>
<start> she came home for the first time in five years . <end>
<start> the village needs your help . <end>
<start> i went to that party . <end>
<start> tom is trying to learn french . <end>
<start> mary makes her living by sewing . <end>
<start> you re old . <end>
<start> have you ever milked a cow ? <end>
<start> how old are your children ? <end>
<start> i don t want to eat anything . <end>
<start> tom has no sense of direction . <end>
<start> tom was the only one who respected mary . <end>
<start> i don t think tom is busy today . <end>
<start> if he doesn t come , what ll you do ? <end>
<start> it s cold today . <end>
<start> tom hid under the bed . <end>
<start> i ve heard of you . <end>
<start> tom was hiding in the mountains . <end>
<start> who canceled ? <end>
<start> tom chose to spend christmas with mary rather than with his family . <end>
<start> the doctor placed a stethoscope on the patient s chest . <end>
<start> my sister is a nurse . <end>
<start> i am writing a letter . <end>
<start> my father contracted pneumonia last month . <end>
<start> the family fortune has increased a great deal . <end>
<start> strange to say , he didn t know the news . <end>
<start> that s a really shallow thing to say . <end>
<start> if you wash apples , you don t need to peel them before you eat them . <end>
<start> she doesn t know how to swim . <end>
<start> how cute ! <end>
<start> can you prove the allegations ? <end>

<start> she is always cheerful and smiling . <end>
<start> where are our umbrellas ? <end>
<start> spring will be here before long . <end>
<start> i don t actually have them . <end>
<start> who gave away the bride ? <end>
<start> why are you mad ? <end>
<start> tom is the only person that has any chance to persuade mary . <end>
<start> i can t hear anything because of the noise . <end>
<start> the shortage of engineers is the greatest bottleneck to the development of our company . <end>
<start> someone is coming . <end>
<start> tom doesn t know whether mary will come by car or by bicycle . <end>
<start> it s a surprise . <end>
<start> we don t share the same values . <end>
<start> tom was sleeping . <end>
<start> we agreed among ourselves . <end>
<start> tom has been hunting for a job since he lost his previous job last year . <end>
<start> they re mocking you . <end>
<start> my dad is the best dad in the world . <end>
<start> i see you going by my house every day . <end>
<start> we re sinking . <end>
<start> the roof is covered with sheet metal . <end>
<start> portugal has decriminalized the possession of drugs for personal use . <end>
<start> the situation is critical . <end>
<start> i ll be at home the next time she comes . <end>
<start> what s going on in that area right now ? <end>
<start> sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do . <end>
<start> where are you ? <end>
<start> i have no proof of that . <end>
<start> tom is extremely naive . <end>
<start> wait until i sit down . <end>
<start> that s what i want . <end>
<start> i have what i want . <end>
<start> i m going to arrange these flowers . <end>
<start> is there a cat on the table ? <end>
<start> her one wish was to see her son again . <end>
<start> they need daily care . <end>
<start> have you gone nuts ? <end>
<start> he is too young to go there alone . <end>
<start> can you walk to school , or do you have to take the bus ? <end>
<start> do you have any message for me ? <end>
<start> i m really happy you could come . <end>
<start> tom pretended that he didn t care that mary was going out with john . <end>
<start> what did i tell you ? <end>
<start> tom begged mary for forgiveness . <end>
<start> you can t learn a language without making mistakes . <end>
<start> you re very smart . <end>
<start> i hope we get some rain soon . <end>
<start> mother suddenly got sick and we sent for a doctor . <end>
<start> which club do you belong to ? <end>
<start> tom winked . <end>
<start> i heard you . <end>
<start> i m in the kitchen . <end>
<start> we re useless . <end>
<start> she is on a diet to lose weight . <end>
<start> they trust tom . <end>
<start> what kind of work do you like ? <end>
<start> her family moved to brazil . <end>
<start> she handed him his jacket then opened the door and asked him to leave . <end>
<start> we woke up after midnight . <end>

<start> if you teach me your language , i can teach you mine . <end>
<start> tom is almost always cheerful . <end>
<start> he promised not to smoke . <end>
<start> could you tell me how to adjust the volume ? <end>
<start> i need to know who helped tom . <end>
<start> this one s different . <end>
<start> is there something that you want to tell me ? <end>
<start> i know only this . <end>
<start> i got my driver s license on the second time i tried to pass the driver s test . <end>
<start> this is yours . <end>
<start> i did that all morning . <end>
<start> the explorers began to suffer from a severe lack of food . <end>
<start> won t you get in trouble for this ? <end>
<start> a bee flew out of the window . <end>
<start> i am busy today . <end>
<start> i feel like playing , too . <end>
<start> tom needs some more rest . <end>
<start> you might get injured . <end>
<start> what you did is immoral . <end>
<start> lemon tea without sugar , please . <end>
<start> you can t go out . <end>
<start> no one can figure it out . <end>
<start> during the day , we work , and at night , we rest . <end>
<start> something doesn t make sense here . <end>
<start> even though he was poor , he was happy . <end>
<start> i ve read all of these books several times each . <end>
<start> he ll help you if you ask . <end>
<start> my parents live in the country . <end>
<start> there is nothing to be scared of . <end>
<start> that isn t french . <end>
<start> cats don t like getting wet . <end>
<start> it s my fault , not yours . <end>
<start> that s unacceptable . <end>
<start> there were a number of students in the room . <end>
<start> i m from romania . <end>
<start> i have no alternative . <end>
<start> tom and mary hugged . <end>
<start> you re getting closer . <end>
<start> how do i explain it so that everyone understands it ? <end>
<start> when was the last time you gave flowers to your wife ? <end>
<start> it s your money . <end>
<start> tom did his best to protect mary . <end>
<start> i am thankful for the holidays . <end>
<start> the dog was hit by a car . <end>
<start> i had no one to talk to . <end>
<start> what if i m wrong ? <end>
<start> i ll call you tomorrow . <end>
<start> is that possible now ? <end>
<start> i m really not too happy about it . <end>
<start> we need to raise prices . <end>
<start> what time did you go to sleep yesterday ? <end>
<start> tom is fiddling with his bow tie . <end>
<start> i used to play with my sister in the park . <end>
<start> she looked at herself in the mirror . <end>
<start> i went to see a movie with tom after school . <end>
<start> i m still mary s boyfriend , i think . <end>
<start> tom s smile vanished . <end>
<start> are you going out ? <end>
<start> she was standing on a ladder painting the ceiling . <end>
<start> he was made captain . <end>
<start> why do you think that i m thinking about you ? <end>
<start> do you have something for me ? <end>
<start> tom got hit by a golf ball . <end>
<start> you stole my idea . <end>
<start> you might be right . <end>
<start> someone came . <end>
<start> tom wasn t even scared . <end>
<start> don t give me such a sad look . <end>
<start> the river overflowed . <end>
<start> the dictionary comes in two volumes . <end>
<start> how many students are there in your school ? <end>
<start> hurry up and get in . <end>
<start> he doesn t tan . <end>
<start> tom has lost his job . <end>
<start> can you use a computer ? <end>
<start> the snow that had piled up on the roof at night came down with a thud . <end>
<start> captain cook thanked the natives for their hospitality . <end>
<start> tom s face feels rough because he needs to shave . <end>
<start> he s a man of importance . <end>

<start> stand up , please . <end>
<start> i m not easily offended . <end>
<start> do you want a bag ? <end>
<start> did you get the flowers that i sent you ? <end>
<start> tom appreciated all the letters mary sent him while he was in prison . <end>
<start> tom s house doesn t have a garage . <end>
<start> we sang in loud voices . <end>
<start> tom wished he hadn t spent so much money . <end>
<start> children are often impatient and restless . <end>
<start> we have no idea where he is . <end>
<start> visitors are requested not to touch the exhibits . <end>
<start> they waited for their teacher . <end>
<start> what do you think is the most popular sport in australia ? <end>

<start> tom was at mary s baptism . <end>
<start> i had a valid visa , so i was allowed to enter the country . <end>
<start> the policeman grabbed the robber s arm . <end>
<start> a passing car splashed water on us . <end>
<start> he may have taken the wrong train . <end>
<start> i guess that she is over thirty . <end>
<start> i had almost finished my work when she came . <end>
<start> i m not obligated to do that . <end>
<start> tom claimed that he didn t know mary . <end>
<start> is there enough money to get a bottle of wine ? <end>
<start> we will run short of oil some day . <end>
<start> i ve never been to a zoo . <end>
<start> tom left his wife for mary . <end>
<start> the time has passed very quickly . <end>
<start> when was the last time you swam ? <end>
<start> i heard someone come into the room . <end>
<start> i just want to read . <end>
<start> i go to the country every summer . <end>
<start> a driver s job is not as easy as it looks . <end>
<start> you will learn to love your baby . <end>
<start> how would you describe your relationship with tom ? <end>
<start> she isn t kind to him . in fact , she s not kind to anyone . <end>
<start> when i got out of jail , the first thing i wanted to do was to eat at my favorite restaurant . <end>

<start> i promised not to tell him . <end>
<start> we have to do something about what s going on . <end>
<start> what was tom looking for ? <end>
<start> she is wearing a hat . <end>
<start> the truth is that it disgusts me . <end>
<start> a good password should be difficult to guess , but easy to remember . <end>
<start> my father is not as old as he looks . <end>
<start> her bed is next to the wall . <end>
<start> let s watch tv . <end>
<start> please wake me up at seven tomorrow morning . <end>
<start> the job is half done . <end>
<start> she became scared when she noticed the man following her . <end>
<start> who said that it would be easy ? <end>
<start> which one do you want ? <end>
<start> do you know how fast you were going ? <end>
<start> can you take me to tom ? <end>
<start> i lost interest . <end>
<start> send it by airmail . <end>
<start> she has worn the same hat for a month . <end>
<start> they go camping every summer . <end>
<start> i wonder what it means . <end>
<start> watch my back . <end>
<start> i don t earn enough money to buy clothes regularly . <end>
<start> she pretended that she knew nothing about it . <end>
<start> where s the nearest church ? <end>

<start> he s a baseball player . <end>
<start> few roads existed in north america at that time . <end>
<start> it seemed like a dream to me . <end>
<start> tom died in prison ten years ago . <end>
<start> tom always feels hungry at least one hour before lunch . <end>
<start> he taught his children russian . <end>
<start> it can t be removed . it s fixed . <end>
<start> i ve hurt myself . <end>

<start> i think i mistakenly sent that email to tom . <end>
<start> when are you going to quit smoking ? <end>
<start> i would like to come to see you . <end>

<start> tom was in trouble financially . <end>
<start> i m sorry i don t have my watch with me . <end>
<start> tom didn t want mary to see him in handcuffs . <end>
<start> please bear this fact in mind . <end>
<start> it s difficult to find one s way around in a strange city . <end>
<start> you ll need that . <end>
<start> you will be ignored . <end>
<start> it is windy today , isn t it ? <end>
<start> this music is from the   s . <end>

<start> we kissed last night . <end>
<start> we knew this . <end>
<start> honesty is the primary reason for his success . <end>
<start> i m on my way . <end>
<start> tom could tell that mary had been crying . <end>
<start> as is often said , it is difficult to adjust yourself to a new environment . <end>

<start> tom spends a lot of time helping mary do her homework . <end>
<start> don t you think it a bad thing ? <end>
<start> tom was dying . <end>
<start> why don t you sit here ? <end>
<start> you re nice . <end>
<start> i know that it is highly unlikely that anyone can help me . <end>
<start> write me an email if you feel like it . <end>
<start> i ll get a cab . <end>
<start> we re the new owners . <end>
<start> the sole survivor of the crash was a baby . <end>
<start> tom has never been able to beat me at chess . <end>
<start> to begin with , that kind of work is too tough for me . <end>
<start> i m afraid it may rain tomorrow . <end>
<start> does tom want a car ? <end>
<start> isn t mary beautiful ? <end>
<start> you re easygoing . <end>
<start> i don t want to do it like that . <end>

<start> my parents sent me a postcard . <end>
<start> tom ate vegetable soup this morning . <end>

<start> tom and mary exchanged numbers at the party . <end>
<start> you re in a hurry , aren t you ? <end>
<start> i don t know what s happened . <end>
<start> speak slowly and clearly . <end>
<start> tom deserted his wife and family . <end>
<start> this can t be a coincidence . <end>
<start> some believe in ufos and others do not . <end>
<start> tell them that there was someone here looking for them . <end>
<start> don t put me in the middle of this . <end>
<start> i love my friends . <end>
<start> even though he has turned twenty , he s still too timid to chat with girls . <end>
<start> you haven t washed your hands yet , have you ? <end>
<start> i see a queen . <end>
<start> i heard that you had a date with tom . how was it ? <end>
<start> i met my teacher on the street the other day . <end>
<start> never have i seen such a beautiful picture . <end>
<start> she asked me for help . <end>
<start> we have to change something . <end>
<start> do you like to drive ? <end>
<start> i love to watch baseball and football . <end>

<start> everyone is equal before the law . <end>
<start> the door was locked and we couldn t get in . <end>
<start> i didn t like him much , in fact i hated him . <end>
<start> the policeman asked people to back off . <end>
<start> traditional japanese sweets really do go well with japanese tea . <end>
<start> i don t feel like talking anymore . <end>
<start> our teacher is a real idiot . <end>
<start> i am doing my homework . <end>
<start> tom drinks a lot . <end>
<start> she got angry . <end>
<start> many lives were lost in the accident . <end>
<start> call the cops . <end>
<start> you look good in those clothes . <end>
<start> i only have one so far . <end>
<start> tom isn t as bad as mary thinks he is . <end>
<start> don t worry . <end>
<start> no one man could do it . <end>
<start> i had bad results this year . <end>
<start> i thought my parents would be proud of me . <end>
<start> the man s behavior was very odd . <end>
<start> he solved the difficult problem easily . <end>
<start> i still prefer doing this the old way . <end>
<start> despite adversity , the architect achieved worldwide fame . <end>
<start> the dog looked into the water . <end>
<start> tom was sitting on a bench eating something that looked like an apple . <end>
<start> tom said he understood how you were feeling . <end>
<start> she ignored him , which proved unwise . <end>
<start> the trees were full of birds . <end>
<start> you said you d be here by      . <end>
<start> it wasn t difficult . <end>
<start> tom got shot in the head by a sniper . <end>
<start> they asked me to make a speech on short notice . <end>
<start> he kept walking back and forth . <end>
<start> they re tired . <end>
<start> i was brought up by my grandmother . <end>
<start> tom was like a father to mary . <end>
<start> you scare me . <end>
<start> i would like you to meet a friend of mine . <end>
<start> she s a single mother . <end>
<start> today s math class was more interesting than usual . <end>
<start> i ve visited nara . <end>

<start> isn t that terrific ? <end>
<start> he signed the check . <end>

<start> let me tell you something . <end>
<start> the doctors wore white masks over their mouths and noses . <end>
<start> i want coffee . <end>
<start> whether you like it or not , you ll have to do it . <end>
<start> today i m all out of ideas . <end>
<start> that s not fair . <end>
<start> we were playing on the beach . <end>

<start> this puzzle has     pieces . <end>
<start> i will abolish capital punishment . <end>
<start> even without makeup , she s very cute . <end>
<start> they were so happy together . <end>
<start> she called him . <end>
<start> he hasn t actually been to america . <end>
<start> he has gone to britain . <end>
<start> aren t you tom ? <end>
<start> i think you should go by taxi . <end>
<start> do you want to go to a movie tonight ? <end>
<start> that s humiliating . <end>
<start> that didn t take long . <end>
<start> this offer expires on august    ,      . <end>
<start> my knife has lost its edge . <end>
<start> i m on my way to visit a friend in the hospital . <end>

<start> i plan to tell tom that i don t want to go . <end>
<start> how many languages do you speak ? <end>
<start> this box is light enough for him to carry . <end>
<start> she told him where to put the suitcase . <end>
<start> tom spent the night in an old hunting shack . <end>
<start> tom isn t mary s brother . he s her cousin . <end>
<start> buy any dress you like . <end>
<start> to master english is hard . <end>
<start> the only question now is how we re going to get enough money to pay our bills . <end>
<start> i was waiting for you to get here . <end>
<start> tom couldn t believe what mary said . <end>
<start> i ll reward you . <end>
<start> they never give up . <end>
<start> the trouble is that they only think of themselves . <end>
<start> please cancel my order and refund the money . <end>
<start> let me call my lawyer . <end>
<start> you can t blame this whole thing on tom . <end>
<start> she spends her free time making dolls . <end>
<start> it is not a watch . <end>
<start> he prefers not to talk about it . <end>
<start> what happened ? <end>
<start> i will be free in ten minutes . <end>

<start> i look forward to meeting you . <end>
<start> give me those . <end>

<start> we all speak english . <end>
<start> he changed schools last year . <end>
<start> to make matters worse , he isn t even conscious of annoying his neighbors . <end>
<start> scientists continue to discover new medicines , so there is always hope for people who are in comas . <end>
<start> you must be crazy to ride a bicycle that has no brakes ! <end>

<start> my neck hurts . <end>
<start> he has a habit of sucking his pencil . <end>
<start> i did that today for the first time . <end>
<start> he s an absolute fool . <end>
<start> the next song i m going to sing is one i wrote last summer . <end>

<start> would you like to sing ? <end>
<start> tom forgot one important thing . <end>

<start> the teachers greeted the children . <end>

<start> tom can t find his keys . <end>
<start> tom and three of his friends went on a picnic . <end>
<start> you came here because you wanted to know the truth . <end>

<start> tom confronted mary . <end>
<start> i wrote down his phone number so i wouldn t forget it . <end>
<start> i have cut my finger . <end>
<start> it makes no difference to me whether you come or not . <end>
<start> they fought until the end . <end>
<start> there s no space in the room for another bed . <end>
<start> that event happened    years ago . <end>
<start> she committed a crime . <end>
<start> i took time off from work and went to the doctor . <end>
<start> tom paid for it by credit card . <end>
<start> it s ok with me if we barbecue , but i don t like it when smoke gets in my eyes . <end>

<start> the boy i thought was honest deceived me . <end>
<start> the concert was successful . <end>
<start> she does hate dogs . <end>
<start> mary and i plan to have two children . <end>
<start> do you think tom can do that ? <end>
<start> he s wearing himself out working so much . <end>
<start> my shoes are gone . <end>
<start> tom said he appreciated that . <end>
<start> the doctor advised him not to smoke . <end>
<start> tom was late for work again this morning . <end>

<start> the more unique each person is , the more he contributes to the wisdom of others . <end>
<start> this is my house . <end>
<start> it is hard to wake up without a strong cup of coffee . <end>
<start> tom used to go out with mary . <end>
<start> would you like to come to my beach party this evening ? <end>
<start> do you need a ride ? <end>
<start> please take a seat . <end>
<start> tom s hat blew off . <end>

<start> i m afraid the doctor is out . <end>
<start> let me come over . <end>
<start> i ll pay for lunch . <end>
<start> i arrived in london . <end>
<start> tom and mary are drunk . <end>
<start> tom caught the ball with his right hand . <end>
<start> who are you hiding from ? <end>
<start> i don t want to know their names . <end>
<start> i sent her a doll . <end>
<start> thank you very much for your gift . <end>
<start> he rescued the child from the fire . <end>
<start> don t judge by appearances . <end>
<start> it seems that i have lost my keys . <end>
<start> water evaporates when it is heated . <end>
<start> even in india things changed . <end>
<start> those are gifts . <end>
<start> they were swimming . <end>
<start> tom asked mary if she knew when the concert started . <end>
<start> please come back home . <end>
<start> i d like it if you would clean this room before i get back . <end>
<start> tom ruined my life . <end>
<start> please don t argue . <end>
<start> it took a long time to accustom myself to the noise . <end>
<start> only four horses competed in the race . <end>
<start> every time i meet him , i feel so happy . <end>
<start> he isn t our enemy . <end>
<start> my hobby is cooking . <end>
<start> tom died in the hospital . <end>
<start> tom looks tired today . <end>
<start> tom shared mary s pain . <end>
<start> i thought you should see this . <end>
<start> i completely forgot about her . <end>
<start> there are more girls than boys in our school . <end>
<start> i ll be back in ten minutes . <end>
<start> i come here every fourth of july . <end>
<start> i have three alarm clocks so as not to oversleep . <end>
<start> i like you a lot . <end>

<start> is tom really happy ? <end>
<start> that s true , too . <end>
<start> everything s all right now . <end>
<start> tom is new . <end>
<start> come here this minute . <end>
<start> he s not in . <end>
<start> he was right after all . <end>
<start> i m likely going to find some way to do that . <end>
<start> he was too drunk to remember to shut the back door . <end>
<start> where will the bus pick us up ? <end>
<start> consider the problem again . <end>
<start> she likes music better than anything else . <end>
<start> the jacksons are here . <end>
<start> please put your waste in the bins outside . <end>
<start> tom floated down the river on a raft . <end>
<start> i bought a ticket . <end>
<start> the electricity came on again in a few minutes . <end>
<start> you have to drive us home . <end>
<start> you should be more careful the next time . <end>
<start> i m sorry , tom . i do not approve of your methods . <end>
<start> the old man told me a strange story . <end>
<start> i had some custard pudding for an afternoon snack . <end>
<start> nobody could give the correct answer . <end>
<start> judging from the look of the sky , it is likely to rain . <end>
<start> could you sign here ? <end>
<start> we have just a tiny bit of garden . <end>
<start> the reason is that i want to be an english teacher . <end>
<start> tom picked up a piece of the broken mirror . <end>
<start> i will go with you after i have eaten my lunch . <end>
<start> the show was interesting . <end>
<start> i want a knife . <end>
<start> the detective disguised himself as an old gentleman . <end>
<start> you decide . <end>
<start> i ve never heard tom cry . <end>
<start> is it good ? <end>
<start> never forget it . <end>
<start> i woke up at sunrise . <end>
<start> i laughed so hard that i cried . <end>
<start> he s nervous and easily frightened . <end>
<start> who told you to tell tom to come ? <end>
<start> this play is a musical . <end>
<start> what he s doing is against the law . <end>
<start> what do you want to buy ? <end>
<start> i don t mind if it s hot . <end>
<start> i fell asleep listening to music . <end>
<start> her neighbor will care for the children while she is away . <end>
<start> whose dog is playing with tom ? <end>
<start> he does not like cats . <end>
<start> i m not responsible for what tom did . <end>
<start> how did you learn how to play the violin ? <end>
<start> my grandfather s picture is on the wall . <end>
<start> get me some ice . <end>
<start> i come home from work about seven every day . <end>
<start> let s stop wasting time . <end>
<start> he is responsible for it . <end>
<start> tom didn t mean to make mary angry . <end>
<start> your house is three times as large as mine . <end>
<start> both sisters are very beautiful . <end>
<start> tom and mary bought a house in boston last year . <end>
<start> i found the box empty . <end>
<start> hurry up . <end>
<start> he walked two miles in half an hour . <end>
<start> tom suggested to mary that she apologize to john . <end>
<start> that doesn t sound too dangerous . <end>
<start> tom had nothing to do yesterday . <end>
<start> tom didn t do well on today s test . <end>
<start> when i see you , you always remind me of my brother . <end>
<start> shall i go on ? <end>
<start> nobody lied . <end>
<start> tom is the captain of this baseball team . <end>
<start> he chose a good wife . <end>
<start> tom fooled mary . <end>
<start> i totally agree . <end>
<start> i ran a race with him . <end>
<start> if you need me , call . <end>
<start> tom and mary have different tastes . <end>
<start> tom bowed his head . <end>
<start> there s not a single safe place anymore in japan . <end>
<start> you must learn english whether you like it or not . <end>
<start> he managed to climb the mountain . <end>
<start> i don t have much time . <end>
<start> our car ran out of gas after ten minutes . <end>
<start> i will become angry . <end>
<start> tom used to be drunk by this time every night . <end>
<start> that s cheap . i ll take ten yards , the girl answered . <end>
<start> do you really have free tickets for the concert ? <end>
<start> it looked so delicious . <end>
<start> have you ever heard her sing on stage ? <end>
<start> i don t need him anymore . <end>
<start> maybe tom likes swimming . <end>
<start> turn off the light . <end>
<start> is anybody home ? <end>
<start> i ll wait . <end>
<start> he comes into contact with all kinds of people . <end>
<start> i opened the door and saw two boys standing side by side . <end>
<start> why are you guys so angry ? <end>
<start> get out of here immediately ! <end>
<start> tom arrived at the party with mary . <end>
<start> i do remember meeting you before . <end>
<start> it s time . <end>
<start> tom doesn t want to give up . <end>
<start> tom is my son . <end>
<start> please come again . <end>
<start> i don t think it s fair . <end>
<start> let s spend all weekend together . <end>
<start> i m never going to allow you to do that again . <end>
<start> tom can speak french almost as well as he can speak spanish . <end>
<start> we postponed our departure because of the storm . <end>
<start> if he had stayed at home that day , he would not have met with disaster . <end>
<start> i made a really big sandwich . <end>
<start> the moment of truth has arrived . <end>
<start> i missed the train by two minutes . <end>
<start> brussels is the capital of belgium . <end>
<start> she belongs to the democratic party . <end>
<start> well , i have to be going . <end>
<start> you re a lucky girl . <end>
<start> boston is great . <end>
<start> i don t want to hear that . <end>
<start> tom asked mary out to dinner . <end>
<start> the judge condemned him to death . <end>
<start> i wouldn t want you to get hurt . <end>
<start> his smug behavior is offensive . <end>
<start> mary is tom s mother . <end>
<start> everyone s looking at tom . <end>
<start> would you like to come ? <end>
<start> tom talked mary into going to the concert with him . <end>
<start> i want to speak with tom . <end>
<start> where do you come from ? <end>
<start> this dictionary is completely useless . <end>
<start> did you understand what he said ? <end>
<start> the president saluted the public . <end>
<start> i m ashamed of myself . <end>
<start> keep this lesson in mind . <end>
<start> does he know what you did ? <end>
<start> who s the last one ? <end>
<start> tom wanted mary to be happy . <end>
<start> do you remember your grandfather ? <end>
<start> he seemed to have been ill . <end>
<start> he s rich and powerful . <end>
<start> they can t hear you . <end>
<start> i m not hungry at all . <end>
<start> nobody can break his record . <end>
<start> you may take either of the books . <end>
<start> i go to bed at eleven . <end>
<start> she took her bike to the store . <end>
<start> tom isn t optimistic . <end>
<start> he disguised himself as a woman . <end>
<start> unfortunately , i already have plans for that day . <end>
<start> tom is honest , isn t he ? <end>
<start> the two sides signed a peace treaty . <end>
<start> is this fish still alive ? <end>
<start> buffaloes have big horns . <end>
<start> that doesn t help very much . <end>
<start> a rabbit has long ears and a short tail . <end>
<start> she looked after the child . <end>
<start> she enjoyed herself at the concert . <end>
<start> is this a flower ? <end>
<start> tom plays baseball like a pro . <end>
<start> they accepted the offer . <end>
<start> some people read the newspaper while watching television . <end>
<start> when i got back , i found my car missing . <end>
<start> we enjoyed playing chess last night . <end>
<start> no one warned me . <end>
<start> i gazed at the sea for hours . <end>
<start> i want a pair of gloves . <end>
<start> between you and me , tom s idea doesn t appeal to me very much . <end>
<start> the young girl wanted to be a star of the silver screen . <end>
<start> she can speak french . <end>
<start> it s a design flaw . <end>
<start> we re here to have fun . <end>
<start> i don t have a car . <end>
<start> i tried to reach you on the phone , but i was unable to get through . <end>
<start> wait a second . <end>
<start> he knows this town inside out . <end>
<start> he said , i m from canada . <end>
<start> the function of the heart is to pump blood . <end>
<start> my aunt showed me how to make good coffee . <end>
<start> these two leaves look alike . <end>
<start> we have to do it . <end>
<start> tom isn t much older than mary . <end>
<start> tom found the note that mary had left for him . <end>
<start> will you light the fire ? <end>
<start> several houses were carried away by the great flood . <end>
<start> you know i m not coming back , right ? <end>
<start> i told tom what happened . <end>
<start> he attends medical conferences . <end>
<start> the heat was unbearable . <end>
<start> i don t really like him , in fact , i hate him . <end>
<start> you look satisfied . <end>
<start> i met my teacher on the way to the station . <end>
<start> how long have you been learning english ? <end>
<start> i m pretty sure that what you want won t cost more than thirty dollars . <end>
<start> do you have an alarm clock in your room ? <end>
<start> she hit him . <end>
<start> i kind of like it . <end>
<start> it s our duty to help . <end>
<start> he proposed that we take a small break . <end>
<start> i fell in love in an unlikely place . <end>
<start> my idea is different from yours . <end>
<start> it is better to ignore this point . <end>
<start> i am convinced of his innocence . <end>
<start> tom could run a lot faster when he was young . <end>
<start> we played cards after dinner . <end>
<start> can you read ? <end>
<start> he reached out for the sugar that was on the table . <end>
<start> tom has a good side and an evil side . <end>
<start> this is tom s favorite book . <end>
<start> there s nothing left to lose . <end>
<start> my sister works as a secretary at a bank . <end>
<start> i can t imagine living like that . <end>
<start> it was a casual meeting . <end>
<start> did i hear you correctly ? are you saying you disagree ? <end>
<start> you are irresistible . <end>
<start> i can t remember her address . <end>
<start> all beginnings are difficult . <end>
<start> it s better than doing nothing . <end>
<start> they are leaving japan tomorrow . <end>
<start> you have to leave boston . <end>
<start> do you think tom saw mary ? <end>
<start> who asked you to do that ? <end>
<start> tom will help us , won t he ? <end>
<start> it took me five hours to finish the work . <end>
<start> do you believe in god ? <end>
<start> give me your shirt . <end>
<start> he was admitted to the engineering school . <end>
<start> i m not going to ask tom for anything . <end>
<start> he lived in spain , i think . <end>
<start> all my friends call me tom . <end>
<start> the deadline is drawing near . <end>
<start> really ? <end>
<start> i was too embarrassed to look her in the eye . <end>
<start> we re leaving australia next month . <end>
<start> tom is very good at chess . <end>
<start> yoga helps her to be calm . <end>
<start> don t point your finger at me . <end>
<start> stop touching me . <end>
<start> tom can t get mary to make up her mind . <end>
<start> there s a hole in this . <end>
<start> were you at the theater last saturday ? <end>
<start> he finally realized that mary had made a fool of him . <end>
<start> it was cloudy all day long today . <end>
<start> do you have any cds ? <end>
<start> was i really boring ? <end>
<start> do you have a soup bowl ? <end>
<start> come here and sit down . <end>
<start> can you teach me how to fly ? <end>
<start> she isn t afraid of snakes . <end>
<start> tom blew all his money on a motorcycle . <end>
<start> tom is very afraid of snakes . <end>
<start> she earns    dollars per day . <end>
<start> stop blaming yourself . <end>
<start> tom began to speak . <end>
<start> he has just bought a used car . <end>
<start> he speaks english well . <end>
<start> please look after my cats while i m away . <end>
<start> i don t remember when i first met him . <end>
<start> accidents happen . <end>
<start> tom s mother was a wise woman . <end>
<start> it was in kyoto that i first met her . <end>
<start> i really wasn t expecting that from you . <end>
<start> this doesn t work . <end>
<start> there s nothing there . <end>
<start> don t trust him . <end>
<start> this is a great theory . <end>
<start> how old is your uncle ? <end>
<start> i ll check your vision . <end>
<start> tom drank lemonade . <end>
<start> are you through with this book ? <end>
<start> the plan has been successful so far . <end>
<start> tom is the perfect son . <end>
<start> tom tried to stop mary from talking to john . <end>
<start> french is his mother tongue . <end>
<start> it s right . <end>
<start> variable names in c are case sensitive . <end>
<start> i hate fighting . <end>
<start> i think this sweater will look good on you . <end>
<start> do you think i m crazy ? <end>
<start> tom isn t my responsibility anymore . <end>
<start> i like your job . <end>
<start> the telephone operator asked the caller to hold on until a connection was made . <end>
<start> we don t want to cause any trouble . <end>
<start> he doesn t know english at all . <end>
<start> tom couldn t decide how to begin . <end>
<start> i have a big problem . <end>
<start> is tom bothering you ? <end>
<start> watch carefully . <end>
<start> tom is still crying . <end>
<start> i m out of breath . <end>
<start> stop pulling my hair ! <end>
<start> keep tom out of here . <end>
<start> my parents forbade me to see tom again . <end>
<start> do you know if he s coming to the party ? <end>
<start> you need a boyfriend . <end>
<start> she is always neat and tidy . <end>
<start> it s always sunny in italy . <end>
<start> what a big truck ! <end>
<start> i m tougher than you think . <end>
<start> give me an hour . <end>
<start> he arrived as soon as he could . <end>
<start> if i were you , i d ask him . <end>
<start> i can t stand this heat . <end>
<start> he accused her of having lied to him . <end>
<start> i am sure everything will turn out all right in the end . <end>
<start> he was very scared when he saw this big snake . <end>
<start> i wonder what happens if i press this button . <end>
<start> i always have two cups of coffee in the morning . <end>
<start> i ll notify tom . <end>
<start> a new year always brings hope . <end>
<start> tom honked at mary . <end>
<start> this noise is annoying . <end>
<start> i need a ladder . <end>
<start> tom comes from a musical family . <end>
<start> i know your older brother quite well . <end>
<start> that bag is mine . <end>
<start> are you sure you want to do that ? <end>

<start> i do not know when she will come back . <end>
<start> i don t know what i m going to do with my cat now that i m moving to another country . <end>

<start> i can t tolerate his rudeness . <end>
<start> when there s nothing left to do , what do you do ? <end>
<start> stand back , please . <end>
<start> did you see my camera ? <end>
<start> tom is making faces . <end>
<start> she has a husband and two daughters . <end>
<start> tom s lying . <end>

<start> they both like sports . <end>
<start> tom nodded in agreement . <end>
<start> she took pity on him . <end>
<start> the game was canceled at the last minute . <end>
<start> i heard some students complain about the homework . <end>
<start> this is the perfect location . <end>

<start> the question still remains why tom would want to do that . <end>
<start> his piano playing sounded fantastic . <end>
<start> we had no unexpected incidents during our trip . <end>

<start> you are important . <end>
<start> i want to grow old with mary . <end>
<start> please do not smoke here . <end>
<start> i m not here to make friends . <end>
<start> he acted like a madman . <end>
<start> i ve got to get back home by midnight . <end>
<start> tom didn t know what mary meant . <end>
<start> what a feast ! <end>
<start> have you ever driven a van ? <end>
<start> you re too drunk to drive . <end>
<start> the decision was put off . <end>
<start> my father is a doctor . <end>
<start> i didn t want to tell you . <end>

<start> would you like me to do that work ? <end>

<start> modern technology gives us many things . <end>
<start> it s too good to be true . <end>

<start> tom was late for dinner . <end>
<start> he is a man who can always be trusted . <end>
<start> his nasty comments fueled the argument . <end>

<start> i overslept because my alarm didn t go off . <end>
<start> i have to find another one . <end>
<start> did you buy it on the black market ? <end>
<start> tom was tall and handsome . <end>
<start> i don t want to give you my money . <end>
<start> the origins of these people is shrouded in mystery . <end>

<start> he was a forceful leader . <end>
<start> i felt dazed when i got up . <end>
<start> i think the mistake is mine . <end>
<start> this movie is worth seeing . <end>
<start> he used to read a lot . <end>
<start> what tom really wanted was a new guitar . <end>
<start> tom has some very radical ideas . <end>
<start> he didn t come on time . <end>
<start> keep them . <end>
<start> your shoes are here . <end>
<start> tom knew that mary was throwing a party . <end>

<start> i thought it might be a good idea for us to get together and talk about it . <end>
<start> tom attempted to kill himself . <end>
<start> we see what we expect to see . <end>
<start> i was held up last night . <end>
<start> tom s son was killed in a traffic accident last winter . <end>
<start> do you like this color ? <end>
<start> he had to tell his readers what happened . <end>
<start> these clothes are not appropriate for a cold winter day . <end>
<start> japan had defeated russia in a war in      . <end>
<start> you re the best man for the job . <end>
<start> tom didn t come with us to boston . <end>
<start> his eyes are blue . <end>

<start> now i understand . <end>
<start> i hate the world because the world hates me . <end>
<start> i don t like getting dressed up . <end>

<start> i m going with tom . <end>
<start> i purchased one bag . <end>
<start> do you want something to drink ? <end>
<start> he doesn t come here every day . <end>
<start> that street is very noisy . <end>

<start> i heard that he left town and moved east . <end>
<start> she fell ill , but got well soon . <end>
<start> he is always talking big . <end>
<start> do you like to dance ? <end>
<start> very few fat men have long noses . <end>
<start> everybody in the building felt the earthquake . <end>
<start> wait until your turn comes . <end>
<start> tom is a hoot . <end>
<start> his assistant polished his shoes . <end>
<start> i think you re perfect . <end>
<start> your parents ought to know it . <end>
<start> tom didn t know for certain where he should go . <end>
<start> he is accustomed to hard work . <end>
<start> we went to london last year . <end>
<start> it was not long before they made their appearance . <end>
<start> this is just a hypothesis . <end>
<start> next thing you know , you ll be in the papers . <end>
<start> she cannot stop him . <end>
<start> all of the buses are full . <end>

<start> come and see me at eleven o clock . <end>
<start> he s the one who told me about that . <end>
<start> the building did not pass a fire inspection . <end>
<start> the statue of liberty is a symbol of america . <end>

<start> that doesn t mean that i will stop doing it . <end>
<start> she did not turn up after all . <end>
<start> i study french at home . <end>
<start> tom has more money than brains . <end>
<start> the eagle soared majestically above the snow covered peaks . <end>
<start> my father does not eat much fruit . <end>
<start> stay on this side of the yellow line . <end>
<start> he is working hard in order to pass the entrance examination . <end>
<start> i didn t know what to do first . <end>
<start> life s short . <end>
<start> he was the man of her dreams . <end>
<start> let s try to treat each other with respect . <end>
<start> tom is a bad cook . <end>
<start> it is true that she teaches french at school . <end>
<start> tom wanted to know what mary s last name was . <end>
<start> who were you talking to ? <end>
<start> tom announced his resignation yesterday . <end>
<start> he had fun with her . <end>
<start> i hardly even know you . <end>
<start> tom wants to play golf with mary s father . <end>
<start> we will take a rest soon . <end>
<start> i wish i could have spoken more french . <end>
<start> sooner or later , he will run out of luck . <end>
<start> be frank with me ! <end>
<start> i see the crown . <end>
<start> the boy fell off the bed . <end>
<start> my parent s house is comfortable . <end>
<start> i think that you are correct . <end>
<start> tom is very unreliable . <end>
<start> i will help you if possible . <end>
<start> could you please move out of my way ? <end>
<start> what is the man doing ? <end>
<start> she had a lazy eye . <end>
<start> the only thing tom needs now is a little patience . <end>
<start> please , tell me . <end>
<start> when s dinner served ? <end>

<start> my mother told me not to be noisy . <end>

<start> i can t straighten out my back . <end>
<start> sorry , i don t follow . <end>
<start> he made an apology . <end>
<start> she has a very enviable position . <end>
<start> we will have a music contest soon . <end>
<start> i don t want to go back home . <end>
<start> there are some flies on the wall . <end>
<start> please wait until your turn . <end>
<start> he wants the most bang for his buck . <end>
<start> this bicycle is mine . <end>
<start> i totally agree with his definition of friendship . <end>
<start> i just want to hear your reasons . <end>
<start> why do you permit it ? <end>
<start> i wasn t ready to go . <end>
<start> he put milk in his coffee . <end>
<start> i d like to study french , but i don t have the time . <end>
<start> i know he is watching me . <end>
<start> each one of us was given three hundred dollars . <end>
<start> tell tom we don t plan go to his party . <end>
<start> she heard someone calling for help . <end>
<start> where do you think the path leads ? <end>
<start> that s a problem . <end>
<start> when will the world come to an end ? <end>
<start> i didn t like the plot of the movie . <end>
<start> how long do you plan to stay in this country ? <end>
<start> tom is undressing . <end>
<start> he can speak neither english nor french . <end>

<start> he uses a pencil with a fine point . <end>
<start> he s strong . <end>
<start> they got married last fall . <end>
<start> he will always be there . <end>
<start> tom wasn t in his room this morning . <end>

<start> i ll do that regardless of the consequences . <end>
<start> he fell into a deep sleep . <end>
<start> tom and i are both a little busy right now . <end>
<start> tom heard a knock at the door . <end>
<start> i stand corrected . <end>
<start> many students like to study in the morning . <end>
<start> tom doesn t know any french . <end>
<start> i m really starting to hate this town . <end>
<start> i ll call you up tomorrow morning . <end>
<start> tom isn t my enemy . <end>
<start> what a great idea ! <end>
<start> they wash their hands with soap . <end>
<start> he went skiing during the winter . <end>
<start> we re going to see him right now . <end>
<start> i had no choice but to come . <end>
<start> i remember meeting the queen . <end>
<start> what is the correct answer ? <end>
<start> do you know tom personally ? <end>
<start> who sent the flowers ? <end>
<start> i enjoy sipping on a margarita with salt around the rim . <end>
<start> it s a problem . <end>
<start> he left after he had lunch . <end>
<start> they did not clap for us . <end>
<start> a toothache deprived me of sleep . <end>
<start> she cried and cried , but no one came to comfort her . <end>
<start> tom bought mary a fairly expensive camera . <end>
<start> you re forgetful . <end>
<start> ali is a good person . <end>
<start> tom put out the fire . <end>
<start> i can t tell you what i think . <end>
<start> that s hers . <end>
<start> we took pictures of the dolphins . <end>
<start> our daughter burned her finger with a match . <end>
<start> he sold all that he owned . <end>
<start> tom said he didn t know the answer . <end>
<start> tom postponed his party until mary got out of the hospital . <end>
<start> i saw a beautiful waterfall there . <end>
<start> she was afraid to travel alone . <end>
<start> i think we need more water . <end>
<start> tom began to cry . <end>
<start> i want you to tell me everything you know about what s happening . <end>
<start> here or to go ? <end>
<start> i was born in      in york . <end>
<start> the drug must go through clinical trials before being approved . <end>
<start> tom parked in his usual spot . <end>
<start> drink a lot of water . <end>
<start> do you want fries with that ? <end>
<start> i couldn t get to sleep . <end>
<start> damacus is located in syria . <end>
<start> tom writes slowly . <end>
<start> we should ve stayed home with tom . <end>
<start> stop talking . <end>
<start> tom started banging on the door . <end>
<start> i thought tom was your best friend . <end>
<start> tom wanted mary to stay with him forever . <end>
<start> he banged his head . <end>
<start> tom brought mary to the station . <end>
<start> this morning i got up too late to have breakfast . <end>
<start> mary loves to ride her horse . <end>
<start> have you read the book tom bought for you ? <end>
<start> i know tom is happy . <end>
<start> is ten thousand yen enough ? <end>
<start> save me some ice cream . <end>
<start> this will give you a rough idea . <end>
<start> do you hit your children ? <end>
<start> you seem unperturbed . <end>
<start> they close the door at five . <end>
<start> i haven t decided yet . <end>
<start> tom seems friendlier than before . <end>
<start> i think you re right . <end>
<start> tom punched mary in the face . <end>
<start> the baby cried . <end>
<start> the baby takes after his mother . <end>
<start> would you like some fruit ? <end>
<start> tom came in carrying something . <end>
<start> he stood behind the chair . <end>
<start> tom is still in the hospital . <end>
<start> tell them to come here . <end>
<start> you re not funny . <end>
<start> she s busy with her work . <end>
<start> would you like me to order it ? <end>
<start> i thought tom wouldn t give up . <end>
<start> i don t even know your address . <end>
<start> he keeps all his savings in the bank . <end>
<start> i want to avoid unnecessary risks . <end>
<start> tom likes you just the way you are . <end>
<start> tom is mary s significant other . <end>
<start> tom was very lucky . <end>
<start> one who has no goals in life , lives only to die . <end>
<start> take any books that you want to read . <end>
<start> tom won t have that problem . <end>
<start> why do you walk when you have a car ? <end>
<start> your students don t like me . <end>
<start> he s a bus driver . <end>
<start> i stood waiting for a bus . <end>
<start> what are you trying to hide ? <end>
<start> around the year     ad , his people revolted against rome . <end>
<start> tom made himself a peanut butter sandwich for lunch . <end>
<start> i am really sorry to hear that . <end>
<start> flags of the world fly proudly at the united nations headquarters . <end>
<start> tom asked mary to take him to the hospital . <end>
<start> he ate twice as much as i did . <end>
<start> if we leave him , he ll bleed to death . <end>
<start> we might meet again in the near future . <end>
<start> he has a sister and she goes to school , too . <end>
<start> tom never told me he was married . <end>
<start> tom didn t want to talk with mary . <end>
<start> i wonder whether tom will be able to do that by himself or not . <end>
<start> the time for talking is over . <end>
<start> i need a pair of scissors to cut this paper . <end>
<start> they lived happily ever after . <end>

<start> i ve been seeking an answer to your question . <end>
<start> the workers asked for an increase in pay . <end>
<start> tom dropped out of bartending school . <end>
<start> you re impatient . <end>
<start> tom wanted to eat at the small restaurant behind the hotel . <end>
<start> even the strongest man can t stop a typhoon . <end>
<start> i ve never seen a real cow . <end>
<start> you always say that . <end>
<start> tom didn t want me to tell you this , but he just lost his job . <end>
<start> the meeting was put off until next friday . <end>
<start> i think tom drank out of my glass by mistake . <end>
<start> older people often fear change . <end>
<start> as soon as i can get the chance , i ll come for a visit . <end>
<start> he capitalized on every opportunity to learn from the great scholar . <end>
<start> don t you know that you are the laughingstock of the whole town ? <end>
<start> i know who took tom . <end>
<start> i ve never seen a live whale . <end>
<start> tom just shot mary . <end>
<start> are you going to tom s party ? i m still not sure . <end>
<start> tom thinks mary should apologize to john for not doing what she said she d do . <end>
<start> we re having a problem with pigeons . <end>
<start> i don t want anyone to play my guitar . <end>
<start> how are we going to get there ? <end>
<start> tom plays organ at our church . <end>
<start> tom wondered how much mary weighed . <end>
<start> is this fish still alive ? <end>
<start> was i about to die ? <end>
<start> it s hers . <end>
<start> this is easy . <end>
<start> tom asked mary where the dog was . <end>
<start> they won t find it . <end>
<start> i owe him some money . <end>
<start> he came in and immediately sat down . <end>
<start> he was the only witness of the accident . <end>
<start> call up tom right away . <end>
<start> tom asked for mary s help . <end>

<start> she refused his proposal . <end>

<start> i got up late this morning . <end>
<start> if i tell him the truth , she will never forgive me . <end>
<start> i m sorry , but i am opposed to this project . <end>
<start> it s not supposed to happen . <end>
<start> why is it the mass media didn t report this ? <end>
<start> tom , i want to stay with you . <end>
<start> she wants to dye her hair red . <end>
<start> tom is breathing . <end>
<start> i speak a little spanish . <end>
<start> tom frightened mary . <end>
<start> i haven t been getting much sleep . <end>
<start> iron is hard . <end>
<start> when my brother was young , i often used to take him to the park . <end>
<start> you re entitled to the truth . <end>
<start> i forgot to pay the rent . <end>
<start> all i really want to do is talk to tom . <end>
<start> i want to be there , you know . <end>

<start> you re the only person i know here in boston . <end>
<start> all i know is that he came from china . <end>
<start> we ve forgiven you . <end>

<start> someone else must ve seen what happened . <end>
<start> tom isn t in his office . <end>
<start> we don t know when this world came into being . <end>
<start> dinosaurs are now extinct . <end>
<start> this is a fact . <end>
<start> i was fired . <end>

<start> we had unexpected visitors . <end>
<start> he earns his living by teaching . <end>
<start> it ll happen soon . <end>
<start> i still have my doubts . <end>
<start> we were friends . <end>
<start> tom might not know what he s supposed to do . <end>
<start> the police carefully investigated the cause of the accident . <end>
<start> it ll take some time to get used to wearing a wig . <end>
<start> think again . <end>
<start> the gate is so narrow that the car can t pass through it . <end>
<start> tom was rescued after being trapped six days in the mountains . <end>
<start> i ll be busy next week . <end>
<start> this contest is fixed . <end>
<start> i don t want to hear any more of your complaining . <end>
<start> tom comes here almost every weekend . <end>
<start> my roommate is crazy . <end>
<start> tom stayed in boston for three year . <end>
<start> the sheets feel damp . <end>
<start> tom and mary are in the library . <end>

<start> tom made it clear that he didn t want surgery . <end>
<start> every even number is the sum of two primes . <end>
<start> we love you . <end>
<start> the past is the past . <end>
<start> i ve never tasted anything as unusual as this . <end>
<start> i m worried about everybody . <end>
<start> i don t want you to tell this to anybody . <end>
<start> five plus two equals seven . <end>
<start> when i got out of jail , i had no intention of committing another crime . <end>
<start> when we landed , we saw our friend on the pier . <end>
<start> we saw a mountain in the distance . <end>
<start> the baggage is insured . <end>
<start> i don t know when i need to do that . <end>
<start> tom is in prison for murder . <end>
<start> she is accustomed to sitting . <end>
<start> tom became suspicious . <end>
<start> tom noticed that mary was staring at him . <end>
<start> it seemed that no one was in the village . <end>
<start> maryam is well behaved . <end>
<start> elephants are divided into three different species . <end>
<start> i told him to work hard or he would fail . <end>
<start> you will always be welcome . <end>
<start> i d appreciate it if you could pay in cash . <end>

<start> checks are accepted . <end>
<start> we re in town . <end>
<start> you re patronizing . <end>
<start> i don t think anyone could have stopped tom . <end>
<start> she is really cute . <end>
<start> detroit is dangerous city . <end>
<start> how many people do you think die from cancer every year ? <end>
<start> they all remembered tom . <end>
<start> tom wondered why mary was so late . <end>
<start> this is no longer relevant . <end>
<start> the commander said they would stay . <end>
<start> while swimming in the pool , she lost her locker key . <end>
<start> i ll call an ambulance . <end>
<start> my answer is yes . <end>
<start> they were amazing . <end>
<start> tom is in love with mary . <end>

<start> i have a very sweet husband , said mary . <end>
<start> i don t want to hear your theories . <end>
<start> we must always be prepared for the worst . <end>
<start> tom said that he was too busy to eat . <end>
<start> iron is a very useful metal . <end>
<start> if he calls , tell him i am busy . <end>
<start> the price of rice rose by three percent . <end>
<start> tom was in a coma . <end>
<start> he has acted on tv many times . <end>
<start> i am confident he will keep his promise . <end>
<start> are you lying to me ? <end>
<start> do you think i m made of money ? <end>
<start> he talks too fast . <end>
<start> i like rice more than i like bread . <end>
<start> can anyone answer my question ? <end>
<start> a fence runs around the house . <end>
<start> she and i hold the same position in the company , but she earns more than i do . <end>
<start> nobody saw it coming . <end>
<start> i have an older brother who lives in kyoto . <end>

<start> he did it right away . <end>
<start> the government makes us pay tax . <end>
<start> where is the end of this line ? <end>
<start> tom wanted to help mary rake the leaves , but she was using the only rake . <end>
<start> in case the shipment is delayed , we have special delay insurance . <end>
<start> the chair is broken . you d better get someone to fix it . <end>
<start> the young boy is in danger of drowning . <end>
<start> tom and mary agreed to postpone the party for a week . <end>

<start> the beautiful girl with black hair was in the park . <end>
<start> as is often the case with teenagers , she s conceited . <end>
<start> they have lived here for ten years . <end>
<start> tom works in a factory . <end>
<start> it happened naturally . <end>
<start> i d suggest you look for another place . <end>
<start> i don t know what i m going to do yet . <end>
<start> he s sleeping like a baby . <end>
<start> the structure isn t strong enough to support so much weight . <end>
<start> he lives by himself in the woods . <end>
<start> i wouldn t have recognized tom if he hadn t been with mary . <end>
<start> they were so busy they didn t realize what time it was . <end>
<start> electrical appliances have made housework easier . <end>
<start> is it really possible to predict an earthquake ? <end>
<start> i wasn t fired . i quit . <end>

<start> they fought for freedom . <end>

<start> tom has serious health problems . <end>
<start> i need to lose five pounds . <end>
<start> what does it matter how they bring up their own children ? <end>
<start> he will regret it sooner or later . <end>
<start> it s only a dream . <end>
<start> hands up ! this is a robbery . <end>

<start> i bought this book yesterday . <end>
<start> we have had a lot of snow this winter . <end>

<start> i want tom to help us . <end>
<start> that cost him his job . <end>
<start> she baked her husband an apple pie . <end>
<start> tom was sad when he discovered that mary was a gold digger and mary was sad when she discovered that tom was poor . <end>
<start> he had his shirt on inside out . <end>
<start> people usually become famous at the cost of their privacy . <end>

<start> i love the sound of children laughing . <end>
<start> he arrived safely . <end>
<start> how does tom feel about it ? <end>
<start> she did it all by herself . <end>
<start> i thought tom would like it . <end>
<start> today we have a lot of food . <end>
<start> what you said is not true . <end>
<start> tom became popular among teenagers as soon as he made his debut on the screen . <end>
<start> she was advised by him to give up smoking . <end>
<start> tom and mary both want to go . <end>
<start> do turtles have teeth ? <end>

<start> i think i ll take the test this time . <end>
<start> he comes here once a month . <end>
<start> he began to eat his breakfast . <end>

<start> the criminal did evil things as a child . <end>
<start> the more we learn , the more we know . <end>

<start> it always happens this way . <end>
<start> tom doesn t sound happy . <end>

<start> tom wouldn t be that stupid . <end>
<start> they were school children then . <end>
<start> this flower is yellow , but all the others are blue . <end>
<start> i ve also considered that possibility . <end>

<start> i don t know her real name . <end>
<start> it s the first time in my life i ve felt so connected with someone . <end>
<start> tom doesn t think that mary did all her homework by herself . <end>

<start> tom is very naive . <end>
<start> there s nothing wrong with tom . <end>
<start> they said they were not afraid of smugglers . <end>
<start> mary will make a good nurse . <end>
<start> tom loves sports events . <end>

<start> i can t visit you every day . <end>
<start> tom fumbled with the doorknob . <end>
<start> how long have you been teaching french ? <end>

<start> i was concerned . <end>
<start> she is always thinking of moneymaking schemes . <end>

<start> the noise of the heavy traffic kept me awake all night . <end>
<start> how many people live in australia ? <end>

<start> it cost about thirty pesos . <end>
<start> tom relaxed . <end>
<start> he was arrested for drunken driving . <end>
<start> tom recommended this book to me . <end>
<start> justice will prevail in the end . <end>
<start> i d like to believe that tom told us the truth . <end>
<start> he kept me waiting on purpose . <end>
<start> that s a good question . <end>
<start> i feel that i understand your feelings . <end>
<start> i have never tried chinese food . <end>
<start> it was in kyoto that i first met her . <end>
<start> tom is dressed in an inappropriate manner . <end>
<start> would you mind showing tom around the city ? <end>
<start> tom is still unsure . <end>
<start> i waited . <end>
<start> do you have any identification ? <end>
<start> you drive too fast . <end>
<start> i thought tom would appreciate the gift from mary . <end>
<start> tom is a nice guy with a big heart . <end>

<start> i ve heard that tom buys things on the black market . <end>
<start> she suggested that the customer buy a blue tie . <end>
<start> where s my shirt ? <end>
<start> i have nothing . <end>
<start> tom kept working even though he was very tired . <end>
<start> they re as tired as we are . <end>
<start> i banged my elbow against the wall . <end>
<start> go to your room ! <end>
<start> we re your neighbors . <end>
<start> i can t remember the melody to that song . <end>
<start> you have made the same mistake . <end>

<start> it has been found that smoking is bad for your health . <end>
<start> how about       ? <end>

<start> tom smiled when mary looked at him . <end>
<start> are you going to do something about it ? <end>

<start> could you turn off the lights ? <end>
<start> i wanted to know where the voice was coming from . <end>
<start> the adventure begins . <end>
<start> tom was tempted to tell mary the truth . <end>
<start> i just don t know how i will be able to meet all my deadlines ! <end>
<start> tom is the real problem . <end>
<start> they re paying rent . <end>
<start> women today drink as much as men . <end>

<start> that runs against my principles . <end>
<start> the smell was horrible . <end>
<start> is it true that thank you sounds like come on in vietnamese ? <end>

<start> would you like to have a cup of coffee ? <end>
<start> tom is pacing back and forth . <end>
<start> where do you think tom is ? <end>
<start> i think we should tell tom the truth . <end>
<start> it costs a lot of money to eat out . <end>
<start> oil has played an important part in the progress of japanese industry . <end>
<start> how do you plead ? <end>
<start> tom gave his dog a bath . <end>
<start> he wants to work in a factory . <end>
<start> the only place tom has ever wanted to live is boston . <end>
<start> who is that boy running toward us ? <end>
<start> my sister is my daughter s godmother . <end>
<start> tom took the cd out of its case and put it into the player . <end>
<start> you should sue tom . <end>
<start> tom asked mary to wait for him here . <end>
<start> you re my enemy . <end>
<start> think before you leap . <end>
<start> i ve only seen him once . <end>
<start> you don t have to stay if you don t want to . <end>
<start> can you open this door ? <end>
<start> tom will call me . <end>
<start> she ignored him all day . <end>
<start> this dictionary isn t mine . <end>
<start> this job is too much for me . <end>
<start> tom said he needed a change . <end>
<start> he saved a child from drowning in a pond . <end>
<start> it s started again . <end>
<start> i just wanted another chance . <end>
<start> tom has just come back . <end>
<start> nobody deserves to die like that . <end>
<start> i don t want him to touch me . <end>
<start> they are very old . <end>
<start> tom was my great great great grandfather . <end>

<start> if you could come , i d be really happy . <end>
<start> would you let me through ? <end>
<start> we were very sad . <end>
<start> i can t walk any further . <end>
<start> everybody loves my cat . <end>
<start> i think you re going to survive . <end>
<start> some people never seem to learn how to think for themselves . <end>
<start> the island was completely deserted . <end>
<start> tom found it difficult to finish all the work in just one day . <end>
<start> i m a teacher . <end>
<start> my brother is now in australia . <end>
<start> i d like to call my parents . <end>
<start> money doesn t buy happiness . <end>
<start> i know what s missing . <end>
<start> why are you acting this way ? <end>
<start> what a collection ! <end>
<start> mary is so pretty . <end>
<start> this company manufactures computer chips . <end>
<start> tom did everything by himself . <end>
<start> i haven t seen her since last month . <end>
<start> it was a new book . <end>
<start> at first , the indians were friendly . <end>
<start> i might vote for tom . <end>
<start> luck has been on my side in this competition . <end>
<start> you are always welcome . <end>
<start> he is carrying a parcel under his right arm . <end>
<start> the dogs were happy . <end>
<start> it was a pity that tom couldn t come to our party . <end>
<start> let me know if you need more . <end>
<start> he was a former university professor and researcher . <end>
<start> they embraced . <end>
<start> we could see enemy ships on the horizon . <end>
<start> don t dwell on your past mistakes ! <end>
<start> i hate it when hair clogs the drain . <end>
<start> he did nothing but complain about his job . <end>
<start> tom needs time . <end>
<start> my money seems to disappear by the end of the month . <end>
<start> what do you propose we do ? <end>
<start> tom saw mary waiting in front of the warehouse . <end>
<start> i only think of you . <end>
<start> we have strict rules . <end>
<start> i don t know either of the two sisters . <end>
<start> the boy carved his name on the tree . <end>
<start> i repeated exactly what he had said . <end>
<start> lightning never strikes twice in the same place . <end>
<start> novels aren t being read as much as they used to be . <end>
<start> seize him ! <end>
<start> she filled her bag with apples . <end>
<start> tom believes in magic . <end>
<start> i tried for almost an hour . <end>
<start> where is tom s classroom ? <end>
<start> we found a nail stuck in the tire . <end>
<start> we ve got it . <end>
<start> this bird can t fly . <end>
<start> tom bought presents for his children . <end>
<start> this looks good . <end>
<start> i think tom shares too much personal information online . <end>
<start> what a pain ! <end>
<start> i ran a race with tom . <end>
<start> tom couldn t put up with mary any longer . <end>
<start> we were robbed . <end>
<start> tom is good at tennis , no question about it . <end>
<start> i can t wait for you . <end>
<start> he screams a lot . <end>
<start> the roses are in full bloom . <end>
<start> i can t say anything about that . <end>
<start> tom is from here . <end>
<start> the food is ready . <end>
<start> rice grows in warm climates . <end>
<start> pleasure s a sin , and sometimes sin s a pleasure . <end>
<start> he used to go to school by bicycle , but now he goes by bus . <end>
<start> her explanation of the problem was nonsense . <end>
<start> we long for peace . <end>
<start> we re not talking about the same thing . <end>
<start> what do you think about your boss s plan ? <end>
<start> old people are usually very wise . <end>
<start> he told me not to tell lies . <end>
<start> he s a junior employee . <end>
<start> the tourists wandered around the stores . <end>
<start> do you know how to use it ? <end>
<start> many fish died . <end>
<start> she doesn t live with him . <end>
<start> i can t stand to watch you . <end>
<start> his word is law . <end>
<start> i woke up at      . <end>
<start> one of her three cars is blue and the others are white . <end>
<start> i see tom every day . <end>
<start> her reputation was hurt a lot by this . <end>
<start> i don t like spicy food . <end>
<start> what a pity ! <end>
<start> are you a journalist ? <end>
<start> i thought tom would want this one . <end>
<start> it won t be easy to find someone capable of taking his place . <end>
<start> i m fine , thank you . <end>
<start> june is the month when we have a lot of rain . <end>
<start> the surface of the earth is     water . <end>
<start> are you at home ? <end>
<start> there are few apples in the basket . <end>
<start> tom seems to have disappeared . <end>

<start> it looks appetizing . <end>
<start> i was listening . <end>
<start> i ve got the car keys . <end>
<start> what do you think she said ? <end>
<start> he earns three times more than me . <end>
<start> he said , it s nine o clock . <end>
<start> call me once in a while . <end>
<start> he seems to have missed the point . <end>
<start> see that you finish your homework before supper . <end>
<start> i remained where i was . <end>
<start> american politics are interesting to watch , especially during a presidential election . <end>
<start> i have a boyfriend who loves me . <end>
<start> i can eat insects . <end>
<start> would you help me if i moved ? <end>
<start> tom hasn t fried the fish yet . <end>
<start> she assisted her brother with his homework . <end>
<start> her hobby was collecting old coins . <end>
<start> get used to it , tom . <end>
<start> the train left the station on time . <end>
<start> they re surrounding us . <end>
<start> i m being good to you this morning . <end>

<start> she got him drunk . <end>
<start> make sure you stick together so no one gets lost . <end>
<start> they had hardly started when it began to rain . <end>
<start> it ll snow today . <end>

<start> let s hope for good results . <end>
<start> i bought him a magazine . <end>
<start> i ll bring wine . <end>
<start> you are no better at remembering things than i am . <end>
<start> if you don t do your duty , people will look down on you . <end>
<start> we re guinea pigs . <end>
<start> let s get this done and get out of here . <end>
<start> i can t tell you what happened . <end>
<start> our team could win . <end>
<start> never tell lies . <end>
<start> you almost hit me . <end>
<start> tom dropped mary off in front of john s . <end>
<start> tom improvised . <end>
<start> i should read the book . <end>
<start> i didn t tell my girlfriend anything about this . <end>
<start> tom came in second in the race . <end>
<start> tom likes japanese food a lot . <end>
<start> our plan was unsuccessful . <end>
<start> when i hear this song , i think of her . <end>
<start> i remember . <end>
<start> the same thing applies to me . <end>
<start> you will miss the train . <end>
<start> the gun went off by accident . <end>
<start> you look gloomy . <end>
<start> tom has done a magnificent job . <end>
<start> i think we do a really good job . <end>
<start> there is a lot of furniture in this room . <end>
<start> they stayed at the hotel for a week . <end>
<start> she owns a very big house . <end>
<start> my business is picking up again . <end>
<start> they sell eggs at the supermarket . <end>
<start> tom said he didn t want anything . <end>
<start> this is how we ve got to know each other . <end>
<start> you made a wise decision . <end>
<start> that s not a solution . <end>
<start> you re going to come up against fierce competition . <end>
<start> when out at sea , to keep the fish that is caught from spoiling , it is immediately refrigerated . <end>
<start> oh , by the way , i have something to give you . <end>
<start> mary is tom s mother in law . <end>
<start> do you want a glass of water ? <end>
<start> she made thirty thousand dollars . <end>
<start> he put great emphasis on this point . <end>
<start> it is a lot of fun to drive a car . <end>
<start> the people next door were annoyed with us for making so much noise last night . <end>
<start> let s not fool ourselves about that project . <end>
<start> the old man stopped suddenly and looked back . <end>
<start> i have three times more money than you do . <end>
<start> the train runs every thirty minutes . <end>
<start> the concert wasn t very good . <end>
<start> i mistook you for your brother . <end>
<start> this building belongs to us . <end>
<start> give me your sandwich . <end>
<start> i have something that you should see . <end>
<start> don t be too hard on yourself . <end>
<start> how do i know if a girl is interested in me ? <end>
<start> i just want to improve as much as i can . <end>
<start> don t forget about me . <end>
<start> he didn t shed a tear . <end>
<start> i m not a doctor , but a teacher . <end>
<start> he is out of his mind . <end>
<start> tom is hiding from them . <end>
<start> tom has lost a lot of weight . <end>
<start> tom s useless . <end>
<start> we may win this time . <end>
<start> did you show your record of service ? <end>
<start> i bowed . <end>
<start> tom maintains his innocence . <end>
<start> you got it wrong . <end>
<start> i ll talk with you when you re not busy . <end>
<start> what s good ? <end>
<start> tom saw the tears in mary s eyes . <end>
<start> i remember that she wore a green hat . <end>
<start> we re very discouraged . <end>
<start> we don t have enough room . <end>
<start> don t be an idiot . <end>
<start> the police found tom lying on the floor with a bullet hole in the middle of his forehead . <end>
<start> we must make do with what we have got . <end>
<start> somebody laughed . <end>
<start> why is tom still here ? <end>
<start> you can t force tom to do that . <end>
<start> good things come to those who wait . <end>
<start> tom has to lose weight . <end>
<start> my apartment is near here . <end>
<start> i m on my way . <end>
<start> saturday was special . <end>

<start> he wouldn t give in . <end>

<start> tom is facing a challenge . <end>
<start> science is too hard . <end>
<start> have you ever cheated on an exam ? <end>
<start> it was cool . <end>

<start> we re watching . <end>
<start> are you proud of your father ? <end>
<start> look at the top of that tree . <end>
<start> i like swimming . <end>
<start> tom left right away . <end>
<start> a new kind of bullet had been invented . <end>
<start> waking up is the opposite of going to sleep . <end>
<start> tom may be desperate to do that . <end>
<start> i didn t have lunch today . <end>
<start> mother and i were in the garden . <end>
<start> we heard gunfire . <end>
<start> tom s eyes were glued to the screen . <end>
<start> i am disgusted with him . <end>
<start> tom and mary just don t hit it off . <end>
<start> he will play baseball tomorrow . <end>
<start> tom said i looked very upset . <end>
<start> what impression do you have of china ? <end>
<start> she saw him at the station . <end>

<start> tom had no chance to tell mary what he thought . <end>
<start> this makes my blood boil . <end>
<start> i hate playing cards . <end>
<start> he was at home . <end>
<start> tom is mad at me and i can t say i blame him . <end>
<start> tom doesn t like to eat onions . <end>

<start> go ahead and ask tom . <end>
<start> this is suicide . we shouldn t be attempting to do this . <end>

<start> your opinion is quite different from mine . <end>
<start> her dream is to visit paris . <end>

<start> tom likes popcorn with lots of butter . <end>
<start> i hope that japan will abide by its constitution . <end>
<start> you ll do just fine . <end>
<start> tom cringed in fear . <end>
<start> what have you learned about tom so far ? <end>
<start> you have come at an opportune time . <end>
<start> is that a personal opinion ? <end>
<start> i didn t go out at all because you told me not to . <end>
<start> she cried until she ran out of tears . <end>
<start> oslo is the capital of norway . <end>
<start> sunshine is the main source of vitamin d . <end>
<start> when did he fall ill ? <end>
<start> you could stop this . <end>
<start> my father is young . <end>
<start> i play video games . <end>
<start> tom doesn t have to listen to what mary says . <end>

<start> tom loved mary . <end>
<start> this is our home . <end>
<start> it s against the rules to smoke at the office . <end>
<start> i m feeling claustrophobic . <end>
<start> i didn t know that your mother lived with you . <end>
<start> a dog followed me to my house . <end>
<start> i don t go to the movies as often as i d like . <end>

<start> tom really knows a lot . <end>
<start> she invited him in . <end>
<start> this time you went too far . <end>

<start> i m a witness . <end>
<start> tom was the only one who didn t laugh at mary s joke . <end>
<start> i like to go swimming in the sea . <end>

<start> has he gone already ? <end>
<start> in a job like this , it s hard to get enough exercise . <end>
<start> do you have a tattoo ? <end>
<start> above all , children need love . <end>
<start> tom is rather eccentric . <end>
<start> that isn t fair . <end>
<start> this novel is boring . <end>
<start> there s a lot of room in here . <end>
<start> let s keep our fingers crossed . <end>

<start> tom doesn t go out with mary anymore . <end>
<start> you had better not go after dark . <end>
<start> the valley was twenty miles wide . <end>
<start> tom is eccentric . <end>
<start> a man shouted something , waving his hand . <end>
<start> he caught a boy stealing his watch . <end>

<start> what kinds of goods do you sell in your shop ? <end>
<start> tom is a stand up guy . <end>
<start> go on . <end>
<start> brush your teeth after each meal . <end>
<start> i thought tom would look more like his brother . <end>
<start> her mother knocked on the door . <end>
<start> the first step is always the hardest . <end>
<start> the weather turned better . <end>
<start> i m convinced tom is innocent . <end>
<start> i am not as interested in literature as you . <end>

<start> his dog follows him wherever he goes . <end>
<start> he s a leading authority in his field . <end>
<start> i did ok . <end>
<start> tom would never do what you claim he did . <end>
<start> i don t like goat cheese at all . <end>
<start> you don t need to suffer in silence . <end>

<start> tom apologized on monday . <end>

<start> there must be a logical explanation for this . <end>
<start> a stranger came up to me and asked me the time . <end>
<start> have you ever eaten insects ? <end>
<start> is he at home ? <end>
<start> where were you last monday ? <end>

<start> i can t attend the meeting . <end>
<start> this english novel is not easy enough for you to read in a week . <end>
<start> i didn t pull the trigger . <end>
<start> tom has a sore back . <end>
<start> he looks gloomy . <end>

<start> you remember it better than i do . <end>
<start> the question deserved study . <end>
<start> i ll come at noon to pick you up . <end>

<start> it s not as easy as you think . <end>
<start> this is the only way to get tom to stop . <end>
<start> i didn t move . <end>
<start> he has a swelling on his head . <end>
<start> she moved here from mexico five years ago . <end>

<start> this artist died young . <end>
<start> they congratulated him on his marriage . <end>
<start> nobody came . <end>
<start> i like it so much . <end>
<start> they invited me to play cards . <end>
<start> this is very exciting . <end>
<start> i don t want anyone to touch this . <end>
<start> is that love ? <end>
<start> that business was a gold mine . <end>
<start> we re rich . <end>
<start> the book is too expensive . <end>
<start> you ll never be alone again . <end>
<start> would you sing us a song in french ? <end>
<start> he knows how to drive a car . <end>
<start> i ll accept suggestions . <end>
<start> i let him sleep at my house for the night . <end>
<start> a society without religion is like a ship without a compass . <end>
<start> since i m not so good at swimming , i avoid swimming in water that s over my head . <end>
<start> mary can cook anything without using a recipe . <end>
<start> my three year old niece kissed me on the cheek . <end>
<start> tom didn t say how he was planning to get there . <end>
<start> what s your favorite class ? <end>
<start> can i have some water ? <end>
<start> it s very relaxing . <end>
<start> people left me alone . <end>
<start> how are you feeling this morning ? <end>
<start> i believe in my abilities . <end>
<start> i have some numbness in my left hand . <end>
<start> i m really sorry . <end>
<start> if you re not with us then you re against us . <end>
<start> who does tom remind you of ? <end>
<start> one plane after another took off . <end>
<start> you leave me no choice . <end>
<start> i have confidence in him . <end>
<start> i m fat . <end>
<start> i like your car . <end>
<start> she always writes down every word her teacher says . <end>
<start> tom couldn t understand why mary had to leave . <end>
<start> i don t want tom to hear about this . <end>
<start> i can t see you . <end>
<start> what s the most disgusting food you have ever eaten ? <end>
<start> tom pretended to be busy . <end>
<start> i don t feel like working today , so let s go play soccer . <end>
<start> they talked during the movie . <end>
<start> tom thought it would be difficult for mary to get a ticket to that concert . <end>
<start> this restaurant only accepts cash . <end>
<start> he asked for my permission to use the phone . <end>
<start> tom was naive . <end>
<start> keep me in the loop . <end>
<start> i hope i can get my old job back . <end>
<start> what you said surprised me . <end>
<start> i have plenty of time to do that . <end>
<start> tom threw mary s book into the fire . <end>
<start> divide and conquer . <end>
<start> she told me she loved me . <end>
<start> she looks happy . <end>
<start> would you like bacon or sausage ? <end>
<start> she says you ll bring some friends along . <end>
<start> we have to stay positive . <end>
<start> where are your papers ? <end>
<start> happy easter ! <end>
<start> tom was attacked by a wolf . <end>
<start> i d like to go to the seaside with you . <end>
<start> let me finish . <end>
<start> tell that person where my house is . <end>
<start> his speech moved us . <end>
<start> i wish she had come last night . <end>
<start> this hat suits me nicely . <end>
<start> he did not appear until late at night . <end>
<start> tom had no life insurance . <end>
<start> good quality fruit is scarce in the winter and it costs a lot . <end>
<start> tom is an activist in his community . <end>
<start> she loves to fish . <end>
<start> in case of fire , dial     . <end>
<start> we will accept your conditions . <end>
<start> come home with me . <end>
<start> tom has a room at the hotel near the river . <end>
<start> i ve been cheated again . <end>
<start> how about we meet tomorrow ? <end>
<start> i cut the article out of the magazine . <end>
<start> i want to see him very much . <end>
<start> tom doesn t know what he d do without mary . <end>
<start> he came here to help me . <end>
<start> tom is always complaining about mary . <end>
<start> the food at this camp is terrible . <end>
<start> this toy car runs on batteries . <end>
<start> she was left alone in the room . <end>
<start> i was born on october   th ,      . <end>
<start> tom said it was a joke . <end>
<start> you play starcraft really well . <end>
<start> he came to my office yesterday . <end>

<start> the show was well attended . <end>
<start> i always get up early . <end>
<start> there are holes in the floor . <end>
<start> tom ended up becoming the owner of the company . <end>
<start> i use google almost every day . <end>
<start> sooner or later , i ll have no one left to turn to . <end>
<start> take off your socks , please . <end>
<start> she has about   ,     books . <end>
<start> in case of fire , break the glass and push the red button . <end>
<start> fight like a man ! <end>
<start> tom needs our help . <end>
<start> we discussed the problem far into the night . <end>
<start> i think tom didn t want mary to go out with john . <end>
<start> tom pretended not to know how to get to mary s school . <end>
<start> do you really love me ? <end>
<start> just as the americans like baseball , the british like cricket . <end>
<start> please wake me up at six tomorrow . <end>
<start> what s not to like ? <end>
<start> he often sits by me and listens to music . <end>
<start> i don t believe everything tom says . <end>
<start> let s go to my house . <end>
<start> he had barely enough money to buy bread and milk . <end>
<start> tom was killed in a traffic accident . <end>
<start> tom is a diabetic . <end>
<start> it seems like this time it s for good . <end>
<start> it s a proven fact . <end>
<start> i have been busy since yesterday . <end>
<start> my heavens , what an enormous box ! <end>
<start> who has the keys ? <end>
<start> i m talking about this pen , not that one over there on the desk . <end>
<start> she did not promise to come here again . <end>
<start> stop making a fool of yourself . <end>
<start> you should spend less time complaining and more time doing something productive . <end>
<start> tom is the guy with the beard . <end>
<start> you dropped your handkerchief . <end>
<start> i want to get away from the noise . <end>
<start> you should face reality . <end>
<start> i could kill you . <end>
<start> tom isn t from around here . <end>
<start> we need a plan . <end>
<start> i ll tell you what i want to do . <end>
<start> it s no use trying to persuade tom . <end>
<start> that doesn t help . <end>
<start> you need to wash your hands . <end>
<start> she choked him with her bare hands . <end>
<start> tom doesn t have anyone to lean on . <end>
<start> is it something you can get rid of ? <end>
<start> has tom ever been married ? <end>
<start> he has already gone home . <end>
<start> everyone dreams . <end>
<start> i guess we re not on the same wavelength . <end>
<start> i invited my neighbor to breakfast . <end>
<start> everyone smiled . <end>
<start> why did you buy such an expensive dictionary ? <end>
<start> your hair will grow back . <end>
<start> the police are looking for suspects . <end>
<start> i don t want the ring . <end>
<start> i d rather live in a wooden house . <end>
<start> he betrayed his friends for money . <end>
<start> tom asked mary what she really wanted to do . <end>
<start> if you have any difficulty , ask me for help . <end>
<start> the train is coming . <end>
<start> is there no other way ? <end>
<start> can you recommend a place to stay in london ? <end>
<start> i was expecting the worst . <end>
<start> they may go . <end>
<start> heat turns ice into water . <end>
<start> tom s up . <end>
<start> i know you re busy . <end>
<start> there s no air on the moon . <end>
<start> tom did it your way . <end>
<start> my uncle has a deep interest in art . <end>
<start> i have a bottle of whiskey . <end>
<start> french is spoken in france and in some parts of italy . <end>
<start> i can t put up with his rudeness . <end>
<start> the ice is very thick . <end>
<start> i injured myself during pe class . <end>
<start> this mustn t be exposed to the sun . <end>
<start> she lost her way . <end>
<start> does that work ? <end>
<start> you are my pride and joy . <end>
<start> this is a book about feelings . <end>
<start> tell me it isn t true . <end>
<start> i prefer to travel by air . <end>
<start> you will all die . <end>
<start> i have high blood pressure . <end>
<start> we climbed up the steep mountain . <end>

<start> you and i have something in common . <end>
<start> mt . fuji is known to everyone . <end>
<start> we re in danger . <end>
<start> i telephoned my order for the book . <end>
<start> i don t feel like eating now . <end>
<start> do you think tom is going to agree to this ? <end>
<start> you re first . <end>
<start> the game begins at      . <end>
<start> stuff happens . <end>
<start> don t use the desk by that window . <end>
<start> it so happens that today is my birthday . <end>
<start> you don t have to sound like a native speaker in order to communicate . <end>
<start> he writes scripts . <end>
<start> tom criticized mary for not doing the job correctly . <end>
<start> the conductor appeared on the stage . <end>
<start> speaking english is very difficult for me . <end>
<start> i hear from him once a month . <end>
<start> i can give you medication for the pain . <end>
<start> you should take a vacation . <end>
<start> tom considered the problem settled . <end>
<start> is it bad ? <end>
<start> we re out of coffee . <end>
<start> i will tell her what to say at the meeting . <end>
<start> tom is our french teacher . <end>
<start> even though it is raining , he will play golf . <end>
<start> do you know how to use a dictionary ? <end>
<start> look in there . <end>
<start> are there dogs that eat raw fish ? <end>
<start> i m going back to my office . <end>
<start> he must not find out the truth . <end>
<start> this is the time he normally arrives . <end>
<start> how do you feel ? <end>
<start> health is wealth . <end>
<start> tom has the key . <end>
<start> those colors go well together . <end>
<start> i ll keep my lips sealed . <end>
<start> some people like coffee and others prefer tea . <end>
<start> it is cold all year here . <end>
<start> it s the best we have . <end>
<start> tom s strong . <end>
<start> i bought a house . <end>
<start> you must keep your eyes open . <end>
<start> that s unimportant . <end>
<start> how will this affect you ? <end>
<start> i ll try not to doze off . <end>
<start> tom borrowed some money from mary . <end>
<start> i work at a language school . <end>
<start> this is a farce . <end>
<start> i want to make a good first impression . <end>
<start> it is still a mystery who wrote the letter . <end>
<start> i was playing tennis all day . <end>
<start> the purpose of our trip is to visit friends and see some tourist spots . <end>
<start> why are you mad ? <end>
<start> if i were twenty , i could vote . <end>
<start> i can t think about anything else . <end>
<start> tom trusted mary . <end>
<start> this song sounds like one i heard a few minutes ago . <end>
<start> the ceremony took place in the afternoon . <end>
<start> my mother tells me not to study so hard . <end>
<start> where did you buy that book ? <end>
<start> you re too young to get married . <end>
<start> tom pleaded with mary to stay . <end>
<start> i hated tom . <end>
<start> i do think so . <end>
<start> take a book from the shelf . <end>
<start> this animal is friendly . <end>
<start> funeral services will take place in the cathedral . <end>

<start> she had to do it even though she didn t want to . <end>
<start> the students demonstrated against the new government . <end>
<start> i decided not to go to europe . <end>
<start> what did you tell tom ? <end>
<start> i forgot to attach a stamp to the envelope . <end>
<start> he loved to laugh and enjoy life . <end>
<start> take off your cap . <end>
<start> i wanted to show it to you . <end>
<start> i ve never worn a tuxedo . <end>
<start> the airplane was flying above the clouds . <end>
<start> it s not worth reading any further . <end>
<start> how can i get rid of him ? <end>
<start> it s worth the money . <end>
<start> she doesn t have many friends in this town . <end>
<start> tom can t seem to understand what mary is trying to say . <end>
<start> tom had a hectic week . <end>
<start> i received a good job offer . <end>
<start> i need those documents . <end>
<start> he took a picture . <end>
<start> i have to do a lot of things . <end>
<start> he is far from perfect . <end>
<start> i like the one with a white belt . <end>
<start> it s an interesting argument . <end>
<start> there is a lot i can t do until tomorrow . <end>
<start> someone stole tom s car . <end>
<start> it might sound crazy , but i think i m still in love with mary . <end>
<start> tom didn t mean to offend mary . <end>
<start> you can t buy it anywhere but there . <end>
<start> ask yourself why . <end>
<start> she was wandering in the woods . <end>
<start> he is watching tv now . <end>
<start> honesty is a virtue . <end>
<start> the baby is screaming . <end>
<start> now i remember . <end>
<start> no matter what you do , don t laugh . <end>
<start> he has a prejudice against foreigners . <end>
<start> she s neither rich nor famous . <end>
<start> some women look more masculine than feminine . <end>
<start> i know it s crazy , but it s true . <end>
<start> my father has been dead for three years . <end>
<start> what time is your curfew ? <end>

<start> i don t know what we can do . <end>
<start> tom and mary celebrate christmas together every year . <end>
<start> eventually , tom found out what had happened . <end>
<start> the number of murders is increasing even in a country like japan . <end>
<start> gold is more precious than any other metal . <end>
<start> you re very astute . <end>

<start> give him this message as soon as he arrives . <end>
<start> tom played a spanish folk tune on his english horn at a chinese restaurant in france . <end>
<start> he called us at the top of his lungs . <end>
<start> i like short hair . <end>
<start> we hired a crane to lift the new air conditioner and place it on the roof . <end>
<start> tom is the only one who can save the world . <end>
<start> tom has changed a lot since high school . <end>
<start> what you are saying does not make sense . <end>

<start> i might want to go with you tomorrow . <end>
<start> that effort bore no fruit . <end>
<start> tom never said anything . <end>
<start> when they are in danger , they run away . <end>
<start> he used to try very hard to get straight as . <end>
<start> he went out for a walk , with his dog following behind . <end>
<start> tom s not coming , because i don t want him to . <end>
<start> he filled the bucket with water . <end>
<start> that is just typical of him . <end>
<start> birds sing . <end>
<start> next thursday is a holiday . <end>
<start> we see each other once a month . <end>
<start> it doesn t sound true . <end>
<start> tom is not as smart as he likes to think he is . <end>
<start> she described him as a detective . <end>
<start> tom reminded mary to go to the bank before      . <end>

<start> he is working hard to catch up with the others . <end>
<start> she helped cook lunch . <end>
<start> tom s in there . <end>

<start> buses run between the station and the airport . <end>
<start> they ate healthier foods . <end>
<start> please play something by chopin for me . <end>
<start> the plan won t work . <end>
<start> mary and tom experienced happy times together . <end>
<start> could you shut the door ? <end>
<start> he speaks ten languages . <end>
<start> i come from england . <end>
<start> what s your favorite ethnic food ? <end>
<start> i feel alive . <end>
<start> compared to our house , his is a palace . <end>
<start> the rich grow richer and the poor grow poorer . <end>
<start> don t waste your allowance on useless things . <end>
<start> haven t we met before ? <end>
<start> tom talked with mary for nearly an hour . <end>
<start> i know a very rich girl who only eats seasonal vegetables . <end>
<start> which do you want first , the good news or the bad news ? <end>
<start> tom may not be as busy as he seems . <end>
<start> i have a twin . <end>
<start> it is good for us to understand other cultures . <end>
<start> she blames me for the fact that our married life isn t going well . <end>
<start> tom came back with a shotgun . <end>
<start> i think it s time for me to turn on the radio . <end>
<start> the wound left a scar on his arm . <end>
<start> nature is full of mystery . <end>
<start> tom certainly is aware that mary is in the hospital . <end>
<start> you re psyched . <end>
<start> i introduced her to you last week . <end>
<start> i need to crunch some numbers . <end>
<start> the guy you want to talk to left two hours ago . <end>
<start> fried spiders are a regional delicacy in cambodia . <end>
<start> even if he doesn t come , we ll have to begin . <end>
<start> well , if you didn t do it , then who did ? <end>
<start> it s a long way from here to school . <end>
<start> this dog barks a lot . <end>
<start> we should remain quiet . <end>
<start> she hates carrots . <end>
<start> my father used to drink till late at night . <end>

<start> i went to osaka station . <end>
<start> i have to learn japanese . <end>

<start> let s start with beer . <end>
<start> it suddenly started raining . <end>
<start> he pulled the wounded soldier to the nearby bush . <end>
<start> i want you to be my friend again . <end>
<start> marriage frightens some people . <end>
<start> i can t remember his name . <end>
<start> it might sound crazy , but i think i m still in love with mary . <end>
<start> tom doesn t even know he s in trouble . <end>
<start> your mother is anxious about your health . <end>
<start> we have yet to learn the truth . <end>
<start> hi , my name is pekka . what is your name ? <end>

<start> what did you do with that car ? <end>
<start> he just wants to have fun . <end>

<start> tom asked john what mary s last name was . <end>
<start> i don t even know where tom is now . <end>
<start> you read my mind . <end>
<start> do you really want to fight ? <end>
<start> monday was so hectic . <end>
<start> i thought tom was from boston . <end>
<start> the coral reef is the region s prime attraction . <end>
<start> the train is passed the switch . <end>
<start> i tried to focus my attention on reading . <end>
<start> have you ever visited the office where your father works ? <end>
<start> how could tom be so insensitive ? <end>
<start> the two friends got on well together . <end>
<start> i m probably the only person who can help you do that . <end>
<start> she used to live in tel aviv . <end>
<start> does the end justify the means ? <end>
<start> his sudden visit took me by surprise . <end>
<start> you are very beautiful . <end>
<start> each boy has received his diploma . <end>
<start> you re a genius . <end>
<start> the professor was criticized by the students . <end>
<start> they sell sugar and salt at that store . <end>
<start> he deserves his share . <end>
<start> this toy is for boys . <end>
<start> our classroom was kept tidy . <end>
<start> he could not get along with his neighbors . <end>
<start> i don t want to bother tom while he s working . <end>
<start> tom doesn t eat fish . <end>
<start> i can t tell you that . <end>
<start> don t tell me you re tired already . <end>
<start> tom became desperate . <end>
<start> by the time i get home i ll be too tired to do that . <end>
<start> i thought tom would be glad to see mary . <end>
<start> he seems ill . <end>
<start> because of the problem of air pollution , the bicycle may some day replace the automobile . <end>
<start> i m tidy . <end>
<start> i ve already been here two hours . <end>
<start> tom has a reputation of never getting things done on time . <end>
<start> i speak only the truth . <end>
<start> this song is for you . <end>
<start> i hope everyone agrees . <end>
<start> i want to forget her . <end>
<start> a team is composed of eleven players . <end>
<start> it was nice and warm inside the house . <end>
<start> tom asked mary to take john to the airport . <end>
<start> the victim had been beaten up and left for dead . <end>
<start> i didn t really mean to do that . <end>
<start> be careful or you ll strip the gears . <end>
<start> he put on his undershirt inside out . <end>
<start> it was a very long meeting . <end>
<start> his health is improving little by little . <end>
<start> how heavy is your suitcase ? <end>
<start> it s been a long time since i ve seen my family . <end>
<start> it s time to go now . <end>
<start> you need not do it at once . <end>
<start> tom brought a gift for mary . <end>
<start> that could only happen if they were still in the country . <end>
<start> she was astonishingly beautiful . <end>
<start> if he isn t sick , i think he will come . <end>
<start> she always wears clothes which are out of fashion . <end>
<start> you ought to have started half an hour ago . <end>
<start> i wonder if i can do that . <end>
<start> she wanted him to say that he would pay the bill . <end>
<start> you d better not have gone out with my girlfriend . <end>
<start> i can do magic . <end>
<start> when i travel , i prefer to travel by air . <end>
<start> a blood vessel burst inside his brain . <end>
<start> let s have lunch downtown and take in a show . <end>
<start> i m an american citizen . <end>
<start> do you want to see your room ? <end>
<start> he asked for the money . <end>
<start> these windows look to the south . <end>
<start> he disclosed to me that he had been in prison . <end>
<start> did you have dreams ? <end>
<start> i ve never been so tired . <end>
<start> i felt a touch of pain in my head . <end>
<start> i followed the deer s tracks . <end>
<start> they finished eating . <end>
<start> it s essential that you understand the situation . <end>
<start> you ll be fine now . <end>
<start> won t you come and see me next week ? <end>
<start> i m going to take the       train . <end>
<start> three of my children died . <end>
<start> mary is going to have a baby . <end>
<start> we need to water the flowers . <end>
<start> wherever you go , you ll find japanese tourists . <end>
<start> democracy is one form of government . <end>
<start> tom doesn t eat meat and neither does mary . <end>
<start> the birds are singing . <end>
<start> she started kissing him as soon as he got home . <end>
<start> the language of that tribe is as complex as any other human language . <end>
<start> she knows your mother very well . <end>
<start> aren t you one of tom s friends ? <end>
<start> it is a very sad tale . <end>
<start> tom wanted to get back home before the kids realized he had left . <end>
<start> i don t have as much money as you think . <end>
<start> i want something sweet to eat . <end>
<start> where s your weapon ? <end>

<start> i d like an orange juice . <end>
<start> tom always wants to sit in the front row . <end>
<start> leave it be , tom . <end>
<start> i was furious . <end>
<start> she could not get over her fear of the dark . <end>
<start> the trouble is that they have no money . <end>
<start> tom expects mary to come back before lunch . <end>
<start> don t use this faucet . <end>
<start> we caught the thief . <end>
<start> tom reluctantly went to the dentist . <end>
<start> raise your hands ! <end>
<start> my brother looks a lot like me . <end>
<start> we don t know anything about him . <end>
<start> she helped her daughter get dressed . <end>
<start> tom is a pretty amazing person . <end>
<start> let s meet again soon . <end>
<start> tom thinks it s better not to lend mary any money . <end>
<start> for certain tasks , my computer can be very useful . <end>
<start> it s an old piano . <end>
<start> i m not working today . <end>
<start> i m wondering what ll happen if i push this button . <end>
<start> large amounts of money were spent on the new bridge . <end>
<start> she plays the piano every day . <end>

<start> tom has some money stashed away . <end>
<start> the company had to let many of its employees go . <end>

<start> tom wanted mary to stay at home with the children . <end>

<start> i gained a clear picture of how it works . <end>
<start> the student body is opposed to the new rules . <end>
<start> i play tennis every sunday . <end>

<start> i was leaving home when tom telephoned me . <end>
<start> it was a great privilege working with you . <end>
<start> where is she ? <end>
<start> tom doesn t know what to order . <end>
<start> she seems to be fond of talking about herself . <end>
<start> i d like nothing better than to fire tom , but i can t do that . <end>
<start> boston is a great town . <end>
<start> i don t care who tom talks to . <end>
<start> fortunately , my son quickly adjusted to life in his new school . <end>
<start> i thought it d be more comfortable if we sat here . <end>

<start> she had a thoughtful look on her face . <end>
<start> tom is the person i ve been looking for . <end>
<start> i m being careful . <end>
<start> the government imposed a new tax on farmers . <end>
<start> it was really dumb . <end>
<start> i like fruits such as oranges and apples . <end>
<start> i think tom is too young to retire . <end>
<start> we left the door open . <end>
<start> tom s wife is a lawyer . <end>
<start> losing injured their pride . <end>

<start> i am afraid it will be rainy . <end>
<start> i want to think about it . <end>
<start> i can peel an apple . <end>
<start> i wouldn t do it even if i could . <end>
<start> i volunteered . <end>

<start> i can t figure out how to solve this problem . <end>
<start> did you really like it ? <end>
<start> sleeping in class is not allowed . <end>
<start> he should thank you . <end>
<start> you can t imagine how tired i am . <end>
<start> she killed time reading a magazine while she waited . <end>

<start> it was hard at first . <end>
<start> the soap irritated my eyes . <end>
<start> tom doesn t want you to discover the truth . <end>
<start> never look a gift horse in the mouth . <end>
<start> my son doesn t obey me . <end>
<start> tom only speaks french with his parents . <end>

<start> do you love him too ? <end>
<start> this tie goes very well with your shirt . <end>
<start> i m surprised to find you here . <end>
<start> we wasted a lot of time . <end>
<start> tom is meditating . <end>
<start> the natives have to defend their land against invaders . <end>
<start> tom might have cancer . <end>
<start> you really have an ear for music . <end>
<start> did god really create the earth in a single day ? <end>
<start> i m loved . <end>
<start> that s my favorite excuse . <end>
<start> tom doesn t want to miss his flight . <end>
<start> tom speaks french as well as mary . <end>
<start> you can buy stamps at any post office . <end>
<start> i think my mom knows . <end>

<start> those shoes go well with this white skirt . <end>
<start> it is time to go to bed . <end>
<start> i think the pay is enough . <end>
<start> the idea of seeing my mother thrills me very much . <end>
<start> tom called mary instead of john . <end>
<start> we got there at the same time . <end>

<start> there was widespread panic after the earthquake . <end>

<start> they carpool together . <end>
<start> at lunchtime today , our usual restaurant was closed because of a funeral in the family . <end>
<start> i have problems with my wife , too . <end>
<start> tom called mary to tell her he d be late . <end>
<start> johnson defended his policies . <end>
<start> when i looked at her , she looked down . <end>
<start> it rained during the night . <end>
<start> i d rather have tea instead of coffee . <end>
<start> certain religions are against organ donation . <end>
<start> he is getting better . <end>
<start> what country are you a citizen of ? <end>
<start> everyone has a right to say what he thinks . <end>
<start> she drew a circle on a piece of paper with a pencil . <end>
<start> i heard the children singing together . <end>
<start> he seems to have a touch of fever . <end>
<start> why is she hiding ? <end>
<start> we have an advantage . <end>

<start> tom ordered a drink . <end>
<start> where s the toilet ? <end>
<start> space travel was thought to be impossible . <end>
<start> does tom often go drinking with mary ? <end>
<start> this caterpillar will become a beautiful butterfly . <end>
<start> i guess it s impossible for me to learn how to play the oboe . <end>
<start> tom knocked on the door to mary s room . <end>
<start> i thought that was your job . <end>
<start> if you want to cry , cry . <end>
<start> are you aware that tom doesn t like you ? <end>

<start> there s nothing unusual about that . <end>
<start> people say that japan is the richest country in the world . <end>
<start> she was a middle aged woman . <end>
<start> the stranger challenged tom to a streetfight . <end>
<start> tom is the type of person who always smiles . <end>
<start> we re starting to question what we thought we knew . <end>
<start> if you don t want this , i ll give it to someone else . <end>
<start> nobody knows what has become of him . <end>
<start> he was mad because he was not invited . <end>
<start> i spent the weekend reading a long novel . <end>
<start> we gazed at the beautiful scenery . <end>
<start> it was a big surprise . <end>
<start> the drain is clogged again . <end>
<start> everyone knows that . <end>
<start> he warmed himself at the stove . <end>
<start> actually , it s very easy to learn . <end>
<start> the old woman climbed the stairs with difficulty . <end>
<start> tom didn t know where to catch the bus . <end>
<start> he lives in the city . <end>
<start> can we switch seats ? <end>
<start> tom was obviously not impressed . <end>
<start> four soldiers and twelve civilians were killed . <end>
<start> she drank a cup of milk . <end>
<start> i know what you re going to say . <end>
<start> he gets along all right . <end>
<start> tom heard this and got angry . <end>
<start> he is tall , but his brother is much taller . <end>
<start> the risk is too great . <end>
<start> tom wasn t the one who told me that . <end>
<start> tom is very rich . <end>
<start> i outsmarted you . <end>
<start> the policeman arrested him for speeding . <end>
<start> the sunset is really beautiful here . <end>
<start> who ran ? <end>
<start> are you coming ? <end>
<start> he rose from his seat . <end>
<start> this classroom can accommodate only thirty students . <end>
<start> she looked at me and smiled . <end>
<start> it is about ten minutes  walk to the station . <end>
<start> this is a common error . <end>
<start> so long . <end>
<start> you can t do two things at once . <end>
<start> i ve never heard of such a thing . <end>
<start> everyone wants to meet you . you re famous ! <end>
<start> after much reflection , i decided not to accept the offer . <end>
<start> is there a museum in this town ? <end>
<start> are your kids still in bed ? <end>
<start> may i ask a few questions ? <end>
<start> we re both idiots . <end>
<start> we need some tools . <end>
<start> he can speak five languages . <end>
<start> minors can t come in here . <end>
<start> we had to put off the meeting because of the storm . <end>
<start> what a disaster ! <end>
<start> tom grew up in an orphanage . <end>
<start> it rains in early autumn . <end>
<start> the pig snorted while rooting around in search of truffles . <end>
<start> tom wanted to be a teacher . <end>
<start> that woman is strong . <end>
<start> now that you are grown up , it is up to you to decide what to do . <end>
<start> this might not be enough . <end>
<start> i liked walking alone on the deserted beach . <end>
<start> choose friends you can rely on . <end>
<start> it appears to me that she feels much better today . <end>
<start> that serves you right . <end>
<start> i need to pay . <end>
<start> i never asked for it . <end>
<start> there was no one left but me . <end>
<start> tom shredded the lettuce . <end>
<start> tom asked mary whether she planned to swim or not . <end>
<start> i like the bright colors . <end>
<start> they , too , were out of money . <end>
<start> i ll love you for the rest of my days . <end>
<start> if i tell my mother , she ll worry , so i don t think i ll tell her . <end>
<start> we re running out of water . <end>
<start> there s only one way to find out . <end>
<start> she had her shoes shined . <end>
<start> i have a lot of things to do today . <end>
<start> i saw my mother hiding the cake . <end>
<start> i can t stand it here any longer . i need a change of scenery . <end>
<start> did you find your car keys ? <end>
<start> we have a lot of friends . <end>
<start> most living creatures in the sea are affected by pollution . <end>

<start> he took advantage of the good weather to do some gardening . <end>
<start> what did you have for lunch today ? <end>
<start> he never puts off anything he has to do . <end>
<start> i need to understand the meaning of this sentence . <end>
<start> tomorrow i have to go shopping . <end>
<start> justice is found in a courtroom . <end>
<start> he did what i told him to do . <end>
<start> tom doesn t know whether to turn left or right . <end>
<start> i think country life is superior to city life in some respects . <end>
<start> i saw her clean the room . <end>
<start> the key is on the table . <end>
<start> it s not good to force our ideas on others . <end>
<start> somebody threw a brick through my window . <end>
<start> who contributed ? <end>
<start> if you need to blame someone , blame tom and me . <end>
<start> we have had enough . <end>
<start> could you give me a few more minutes ? <end>
<start> i nearly died . <end>
<start> this ain t normal . <end>
<start> this bird can imitate the human voice . <end>
<start> this is the biggest hotel in this city . <end>
<start> tom usually keeps things to himself . <end>
<start> i wanted tom to know what happened to us . <end>
<start> a cat has seven lives . <end>
<start> tom doesn t want any trouble . <end>
<start> we have two ears . <end>
<start> i m not sure what i should do . <end>
<start> there was an eerie silence . <end>
<start> tom came to talk to me this afternoon . <end>
<start> she lost a book . <end>
<start> tom wanted to polish his shoes . <end>
<start> how many christmas cards did you get last year ? <end>
<start> there are around three thousand mosques in istanbul . <end>
<start> i demand to speak with my lawyer . <end>
<start> by postponing what you have to do , you run the risk of never being able to do it . <end>
<start> i will give you a call as soon as i get home . <end>
<start> he is able to speak ten languages . <end>
<start> tom has a canadian wife . <end>
<start> wait for us . <end>
<start> he held the wheel with one hand and waved to me with the other . <end>
<start> we want to hire someone who can speak french fluently . <end>
<start> i think everybody is ready . <end>
<start> tom stopped me from leaving the classroom . <end>
<start> tom is leaving in three days . <end>
<start> who told you to say that to me ? <end>
<start> it costs   euros . <end>
<start> did you turn the stove off ? <end>
<start> tom knew he could count on mary . <end>
<start> do you have paper ? <end>
<start> there was a tower on the top of the mountain . <end>
<start> she was advised by him to stop smoking . <end>
<start> do you know a good way to learn new words ? <end>
<start> she was accepted by harvard . <end>
<start> i couldn t understand his joke . <end>
<start> is it really possible ? <end>
<start> we gather together every friday . <end>
<start> we need to study more . <end>
<start> man is the only animal that laughs . <end>

<start> i m colorblind . i can t tell red from green . <end>
<start> i can t find my glasses . <end>
<start> did you really expect him to tell you the truth ? <end>
<start> tom woke mary up . <end>
<start> tom was sweating profusely after a half an hour on the treadmill . <end>
<start> i doubt that tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done . <end>
<start> the judge fined him five dollars . <end>
<start> tom is three inches taller than i am . <end>
<start> she s very happy go lucky . <end>
<start> japan maintains friendly relations with the united states . <end>
<start> that was not necessary . <end>
<start> he is in great trouble . <end>
<start> she has a book . <end>
<start> let me leave ! <end>
<start> they don t have a shed . <end>
<start> would you like anything else ? <end>
<start> tom wants to thank you . <end>
<start> mary is the only person for me . <end>
<start> i cut my finger peeling potatoes . <end>
<start> our children like dogs , but i prefer cats . <end>
<start> he held a package under his arm . <end>
<start> she was advised by him to give up drinking . <end>
<start> i thought tom would stop by and say hello . <end>
<start> we all breathed a sigh of relief . <end>
<start> i know what i want . <end>
<start> did you leave a tip ? <end>
<start> do you have better quality ones ? <end>
<start> please bring me a cup of tea . <end>
<start> tom doesn t think mary and i can take care of ourselves . <end>
<start> please excuse me for coming late . <end>
<start> tom dove into the water . <end>
<start> tom makes his own wine . <end>
<start> this is the watch i bought yesterday . <end>
<start> do you have a coin ? <end>
<start> tom got back together with mary . <end>
<start> i found this movie very interesting . <end>
<start> she makes all her own clothes . <end>
<start> you must answer these questions . <end>
<start> tom is a creep . <end>
<start> tom doesn t feel like studying . <end>
<start> tom kept scribbling . <end>
<start> i pretended i didn t understand . <end>
<start> he was nearly run over by a car . <end>
<start> i need it as soon as possible . <end>
<start> i m amazed that you say that . <end>
<start> the ship went through the suez canal . <end>
<start> i understand it . <end>
<start> when can i see you next time ? <end>
<start> it s obvious that you told a lie . <end>
<start> i probably won t watch tv tonight . <end>
<start> check around . <end>
<start> the trouble is that i have no money with me . <end>
<start> tom said that he was feeling tired . <end>
<start> i ll be back soon . i have to run to the post office . <end>
<start> this medicine must not be placed within the reach of children . <end>
<start> no one speaks this language anymore . <end>
<start> tom isn t good at math . <end>
<start> he gave in . <end>
<start> aren t you tired ? <end>
<start> i am going to america by plane . <end>
<start> they chased others away . <end>
<start> the room was quiet . <end>
<start> i need sleep . <end>
<start> i think you should tell tom that . <end>
<start> have you ever been mugged ? <end>
<start> he can read . <end>
<start> everybody knows that old trapper . <end>
<start> there s nothing else i can do . <end>
<start> if you don t want to read , then don t read . <end>
<start> i m hurt . <end>
<start> tom walked down the path , whistling a happy tune . <end>
<start> i know this is stupid . <end>
<start> i want to raise a family . <end>
<start> mary said that she loved me , but i didn t believe her . <end>
<start> ask her her name . <end>
<start> the pot is boiling over . <end>
<start> he calculated the speed of light . <end>
<start> although tom is sick , he plans to get his homework done on time . <end>
<start> you are our new neighbor . <end>
<start> it s not blood . it s tomato sauce . <end>
<start> tom showed up just in time . <end>
<start> can you speak french ? <end>
<start> the band upped the number of shows in their tour . <end>
<start> i would like to go to france . <end>
<start> i know i should stay a little bit longer . <end>
<start> he is ashamed to ask questions . <end>
<start> how is it that you know so much about japanese history ? <end>
<start> i fix broken radios . <end>
<start> by seven o clock in the evening , the streets are deserted in this town . <end>
<start> who do you think broke the window ? <end>
<start> i was wondering if you were going to show up today . <end>
<start> i cut myself . <end>
<start> the two laughed . <end>
<start> i hate working . <end>
<start> what happened in the park ? <end>
<start> i know when i m being deceived . <end>
<start> are you losing your mind ? <end>
<start> read as many newspapers as you can so as to keep up with the times . <end>
<start> i ll wait a day or two . <end>
<start> tom could see mary . <end>
<start> i ll bring my sister when i come next time . <end>
<start> he was silent for what seemed to me an hour . <end>
<start> this is all that i know . <end>
<start> he said that he had left his wallet at home . <end>
<start> tom and mary don t have much in common . <end>
<start> this song is very popular in japan . <end>
<start> tom broke into the deserted shack . <end>
<start> i m the person who has to do that . <end>
<start> he gave her a box . <end>
<start> i was a little disappointed . <end>
<start> her eyes filled with tears . <end>
<start> they set out on a picnic . <end>
<start> i wake him up at   every morning . <end>
<start> i was invited to lunch . <end>
<start> why do you want such an old car ? <end>
<start> eat everything on your plate . <end>
<start> i ve run out of money . <end>
<start> tom can t swim as fast as mary . <end>
<start> i hate that song . <end>
<start> he often makes people angry . <end>
<start> simmer the butter and garlic in a small saucepan . <end>
<start> he had two or three rather competent assistants . <end>
<start> tom pretended not to know what to do . <end>
<start> i want to eat korean food . <end>
<start> there is nothing to do today . <end>
<start> where am i ? <end>
<start> he said his father was ill , but that was a lie . <end>
<start> tom relented . <end>
<start> those two boys are cousins . <end>
<start> i was at home until noon yesterday . <end>
<start> i assure you this isn t a joke . <end>
<start> i found it in the attic . <end>
<start> tom put his wallet on top of the dresser . <end>
<start> tom is a failure as a father . <end>
<start> tom is worried about losing his job . <end>
<start> he took off his hat . <end>
<start> anyway , i ll take a chance . <end>
<start> i never knew tom s mother was japanese . <end>
<start> japan is one of the greatest economic powers in the world . <end>
<start> please change the punctuation . <end>

<start> he had his license taken away because of reckless driving . <end>
<start> i lied to you . <end>
<start> tom doesn t have much time to waste . <end>
<start> your watch is on the desk . <end>

<start> i think tom means just what he said . <end>
<start> roll up your right sleeve . <end>
<start> i am an american . <end>
<start> nobody believed you . <end>
<start> he asked for more money . <end>
<start> i had nothing to do with the accident . <end>

<start> i have my own way of solving it . <end>
<start> she always expects me to help her . <end>
<start> tom doesn t know where to go . <end>

<start> the differences were minor , so i ignored them . <end>
<start> tom doesn t think this is a coincidence . <end>
<start> where do you live ? <end>
<start> i think you know what i mean . <end>

<start> i carelessly dropped a vase . <end>

<start> we killed time by playing cards . <end>
<start> this tastes good . <end>
<start> what does tom get in return for all the work he s done ? <end>
<start> the glass is dirty . <end>
<start> these items are rather hard to obtain . <end>
<start> happy thanksgiving ! <end>
<start> a bystander videotaped the police beating using their cell phone . <end>
<start> the box is almost empty . <end>
<start> how many guitars do you own ? <end>
<start> there were penguin footprints in the sand . <end>
<start> she suggested that i take him to the zoo . <end>
<start> i thought it would be best if you told tom yourself . <end>
<start> they made me an offer i couldn t refuse . <end>
<start> tom talked to mary . <end>
<start> i ll go change my clothes . <end>
<start> it was yesterday that i saw him walking down the street . <end>

<start> i hadn t expected anyone to be home . <end>
<start> what little money i had was stolen . <end>
<start> we re starting to work today . <end>
<start> maybe it ll snow . <end>
<start> you ought to have read the book . <end>
<start> you are very fortunate that you have such friends . <end>
<start> it s very frustrating . <end>
<start> we have a guest . <end>
<start> how likely is that ? <end>
<start> it was no trouble . <end>
<start> he was alone . <end>
<start> tom looked both ways before he crossed the busy street . <end>
<start> are you closer to your mother or to your father ? <end>
<start> he became a successful lawyer . <end>
<start> you re over thinking this . <end>
<start> if you help me , i ll try it again . <end>
<start> the bacteria that are transferred during a kiss help improve your immune system . <end>

<start> she forgot that she bought him a present . <end>
<start> you don t have to go to the party if you don t want to . <end>
<start> tom teaches us french . <end>
<start> keep your eyes closed until i tell you to open them . <end>
<start> some people describe tom as a cross between robin hood and zorro . <end>
<start> tom seems to believe everything mary says . <end>
<start> tom should be back by      . <end>
<start> as soon as i can get a decent video camera , i ll start making videos to put online . <end>
<start> you like elephants . <end>
<start> this is not a small problem . <end>
<start> there is no scientific basis for these claims . <end>
<start> my mother gave me what i wanted for lunch . <end>
<start> i ll wait another five minutes . <end>
<start> i like animals , for example , cats and dogs . <end>
<start> he wants the money . <end>
<start> tom is a thirteen year old boy . <end>
<start> how long did you wait ? <end>
<start> tom isn t like other boys . <end>
<start> tom doesn t believe that ghosts exist . <end>
<start> we ve been here for a couple of minutes . <end>
<start> tom can no longer be a member of our committee . <end>
<start> how likely is that ? <end>
<start> i am very grateful for your help . <end>
<start> tom helped mary with her homework . <end>
<start> there is no wine in that bottle . <end>
<start> the couple doesn t fight often these days , but they used to a lot . <end>

<start> tom always eats before going to work . <end>
<start> tom wrote the script . <end>
<start> i went to the park to play tennis . <end>
<start> i met a friend . <end>
<start> be prepared . <end>
<start> if you go out so lightly dressed , you ll catch a cold . <end>
<start> the financial situation is getting worse week by week . <end>
<start> he looks young . <end>
<start> he said , i m from canada . <end>
<start> we ve been very busy for the last few days . <end>
<start> tom got in the car and started the engine . <end>
<start> i don t know why we need to do that . <end>
<start> mary sings in the church choir . <end>
<start> so , where do you want to do this ? <end>
<start> he helped me clean up the mess . <end>
<start> his novels are too deep for me . <end>
<start> she s annoying and selfish . <end>
<start> i have a friend who works as a volunteer . <end>
<start> try again . <end>
<start> i hope you change your mind . <end>
<start> i feel like going out rather than staying at home today . <end>
<start> he ordered me to stand up . <end>
<start> this is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen . <end>
<start> it seemed that he had visited the office . <end>
<start> i d never heard that joke before . <end>
<start> get some sleep . <end>
<start> tom feels much better now . <end>
<start> they followed you here . <end>
<start> we had a wonderful holiday in sweden . <end>

<start> i don t want to run into tom . <end>
<start> it saddens me to hear you say that . <end>
<start> tom cut the turkey with an electric knife . <end>
<start> you ll catch up . <end>
<start> it s not cheap . <end>
<start> my dog often pretends to be asleep . <end>
<start> i worked in this factory . <end>

<start> i don t want to play checkers . <end>
<start> tom has no idea how to answer mary s questions . <end>
<start> it is not so difficult as you think . <end>
<start> they nodded to each other . <end>
<start> the men are all asleep . <end>
<start> my favorite food is ice cream . <end>
<start> both of them seem suspicious . <end>
<start> may god reward you . <end>

<start> tom wasn t expecting anybody . <end>
<start> are they in the gym ? <end>
<start> he took off his coat . <end>
<start> he walked so fast that she couldn t keep up with him . <end>
<start> this game is similar in some ways to today s american football . <end>
<start> he asked lincoln to say a few words . <end>

<start> the president abolished slavery . <end>
<start> she told me she would be here about six . <end>
<start> who invented the first automobile ? <end>
<start> he fell off the horse . <end>

<start> i m sure everything will be fine . <end>
<start> that isn t very likely to happen . <end>
<start> he earned money by delivering newspapers . <end>
<start> tom is a spoiled child . <end>
<start> there re more than     people in the room . <end>
<start> don t you get bored when you re alone ? <end>
<start> he is very tall . <end>
<start> tom doesn t want mary to touch him . <end>
<start> i just want to ask you a question . <end>
<start> it s not clear who tom was trying to impress . <end>

<start> tom asked mary for something hot to drink . <end>
<start> who is absent ? <end>
<start> he talks to me a lot . <end>
<start> which do you prefer , white wine or red wine ? <end>
<start> some incidents from my childhood are crystal clear , others are just a dim memory . <end>
<start> do they sell notebooks at that store ? <end>
<start> i had no doubt that tom would do what we asked . <end>
<start> to the best of my knowledge , this chemical will prevent germs from breeding . <end>
<start> it s already time to go home . <end>
<start> i think tom and mary are in love . <end>
<start> today the weather s not as good as yesterday . <end>
<start> i didn t want to know . <end>
<start> i just shot someone , i think . <end>
<start> is there an air gauge here ? <end>
<start> i hope you know what you re doing . <end>
<start> tom is a stranger here . <end>
<start> the tigers escaped from the zoo . <end>
<start> gamblers enjoy taking risks . <end>
<start> tom worked most of his life . <end>
<start> adding comments makes the code easier to read . <end>
<start> you know very well what i mean . <end>
<start> while we re waiting , why don t you tell me what happened ? <end>
<start> i can t imagine life on another planet . <end>

<start> i was at the reception . <end>
<start> i thought you said the police would never find us here . <end>
<start> the light turned red . <end>
<start> back away from tom . <end>
<start> a massive flood paralyzed the local transportation network . <end>
<start> i made this food myself . <end>
<start> i don t trust you either . <end>

<start> love is hard to define . <end>
<start> she gave him something hot to drink . <end>
<start> you can t send christmas cards to everyone . <end>
<start> you ran as fast as you could . <end>
<start> tom seems to be unwilling to tell mary what happened . <end>
<start> many people believe acupuncture can cure diseases . <end>
<start> we have no extra money . <end>
<start> he has always been at the head of the class . <end>
<start> a strange sound was heard from behind the door . <end>

<start> i prefer to remain seated . <end>
<start> our train reached rome after dark . <end>

<start> it could be a coincidence . <end>
<start> the temperature is forty below . <end>

<start> she started doing her homework right after dinner . <end>
<start> why did you use up all the money ? <end>
<start> i thought you were at the gym . <end>
<start> i like dark red better . <end>

<start> his grandfather is still very healthy for his age . <end>
<start> enthusiasm is contagious . <end>
<start> being happy doesn t mean that everything is perfect , but rather that you ve decided to look beyond the imperfections . <end>
<start> tom said he was worn out . <end>
<start> i don t want to remember . <end>
<start> he put me in touch with the kidnappers . <end>
<start> great ! we ll go together . <end>
<start> do you want me to get rid of this ? <end>
<start> he has not yet recovered consciousness . <end>

<start> tom and mary have been married for over thirty years . <end>
<start> tom s remark was insensitive . <end>
<start> you shouldn t have said that . <end>
<start> my house is close to the school . <end>
<start> put tom on a bus . <end>
<start> i have something to talk over with you . <end>
<start> mary has big eyes . <end>
<start> although it was raining , i had to go out . <end>
<start> tom could ve hurt me worse . <end>

<start> tom wanted to send a message . <end>
<start> don t call me anymore . <end>
<start> i knew tom would be here . <end>
<start> were you worried ? <end>
<start> tom needs to clean his room . <end>
<start> my father must do the work . <end>
<start> this smells like cheese . <end>
<start> you re too young to marry . <end>
<start> tom would never have approved . <end>
<start> i ve made up my mind to give back all the money i stole . <end>
<start> it s more than just that . <end>

<start> what is tom trying to say ? <end>
<start> a sentence normally has a subject and a verb . <end>
<start> you re not canadian . <end>
<start> it s futile . <end>
<start> he fell asleep right away . <end>
<start> i don t owe anyone anything . <end>
<start> mary stared back at him in surprise . <end>
<start> i live in boston now . <end>
<start> he was not the kind of man that people liked . <end>
<start> he gained nothing by telling me that . <end>
<start> how much can you bet ? <end>
<start> tom said that he was angry . <end>
<start> what have you done to your ear ? <end>

<start> why do you need a new ladder ? <end>

<start> women hate tom . <end>
<start> we re in the house . <end>

<start> his story was published in a magazine . <end>
<start> he is nasty . <end>

<start> i miss you badly . <end>
<start> tom has trouble concentrating on one thing . <end>

<start> he became world famous . <end>
<start> where do i go after i pick up my baggage ? <end>
<start> it wouldn t have been safe to do that . <end>
<start> i never thought i would have to support such a large family . <end>
<start> i was wrong . <end>
<start> he turned to his friends for help . <end>
<start> how did he take the news ? <end>
<start> my brother likes horror movies . <end>
<start> that wasn t good . <end>
<start> can you guess the worth of the diamond ? <end>
<start> it is hard to adapt this story for children . <end>
<start> i can t say . <end>

<start> it depends on the context . <end>
<start> i felt rather puzzled . <end>
<start> tom would never sell his car to you . <end>
<start> i am very happy to hear about your engagement . <end>
<start> tom enrolled in night classes at a local college . <end>
<start> i will help as much as i can . <end>
<start> if you had helped me , i could have accomplished the work . <end>
<start> tom is depressed and upset . <end>
<start> walk more slowly . <end>
<start> tom kissed mary and apologized . <end>
<start> tom asked mary to think it over . <end>
<start> tom had some interesting news . <end>

<start> we will talk about this later . <end>
<start> the government should invest more money in agriculture . <end>
<start> who does tom think he is anyway ? <end>
<start> an ugly man knocked on my door . <end>

<start> i think it s unlikely that i ll be able to pass my driving test . <end>
<start> is eating liver good for you ? <end>
<start> when you breathe out in cold weather , you can see your breath . <end>
<start> i ll never leave you alone again . <end>

<start> mary bought a present for her friend s daughter . <end>
<start> my uncle died of cancer . <end>
<start> the boss made them work day and night . <end>
<start> it must be hard for you . <end>
<start> when tom was a kid , he used to collect his father s cigarette butts until he had enough tobacco to roll a cigarette for himself . <end>
<start> hold on a sec . <end>
<start> i m dying of hunger . <end>
<start> tom filled the bottle with water . <end>
<start> i bear him no malice . <end>
<start> tom used to do that . <end>

<start> tom should be home by      . <end>
<start> she plays tennis every day . <end>
<start> he s a good person . <end>
<start> she urged him to consider the request . <end>
<start> poverty had taught him to stand on his own feet . <end>
<start> i know you ll make the right decision . <end>

<start> suicide is a desperate act . <end>
<start> tom asked for a table near the window . <end>

<start> navigation was difficult because there were mines . <end>
<start> tom and mary talked about what had happened . <end>
<start> these are my books . <end>
<start> this is one of the best local newspapers . <end>
<start> school begins at nine and is over at six . <end>
<start> there will be milk and cookies . <end>
<start> tom didn t tell mary how much money he had spent . <end>
<start> tom is a troublemaker . <end>
<start> tom wasn t paying attention . <end>
<start> maybe it was stupid of me to think that tom would really help us . <end>
<start> there s something i have to let you know right away . <end>

<start> i can t tell you how happy i am that you ve come to visit us . <end>
<start> who wants to watch a video ? <end>
<start> i feel helpless . <end>

<start> how could i forget ? <end>
<start> tom lied to mary about everything . <end>
<start> i can t control tom . <end>
<start> the child ran to his mother . <end>
<start> tom is a good father . <end>
<start> you look bored . <end>
<start> i want to tell you what happened . <end>
<start> this isn t a party . <end>

<start> his story is much more interesting than hers . <end>
<start> the students assembled in the classroom . <end>
<start> what happened this morning ? <end>
<start> i can t believe you re doing this to me . <end>
<start> you should have told him about it while he was here . <end>
<start> they went hand in hand . <end>
<start> when he was young , he sometimes played soccer . <end>
<start> i can t send you all the files at the same time . <end>
<start> tom died in his seventies . <end>
<start> i had to walk home . <end>
<start> even intelligent people are sometimes absent minded . <end>
<start> have you spoken with tom yet ? <end>
<start> there were fifty entries for the race . <end>
<start> he will be here any moment . <end>
<start> this side of the house catches the morning sun . <end>

<start> he was more surprised than i had expected . <end>

<start> he s old enough to drive a car . <end>
<start> she went into the kitchen to see who was there , but there was nobody there . <end>
<start> after three drinks , the man passed out . <end>
<start> the walls of my room are green . <end>

<start> that girl is under the delusion that she is a princess . <end>
<start> you re very clever . <end>
<start> the policeman arrested him for drunken driving . <end>

<start> do you want it ? <end>
<start> i told you , but you didn t pay attention . <end>
<start> that s my favorite chair . <end>
<start> i m not your daughter . <end>

<start> hide the money . <end>
<start> he doesn t want to talk about it . <end>

<start> he wrote his comments in the margin of the composition . <end>
<start> when is your school festival ? <end>
<start> this looks like a gunshot wound . <end>
<start> i had to go there yesterday . <end>
<start> is he right ? <end>
<start> tom is taking the week off . <end>
<start> tom becomes nervous whenever he has to speak in public . <end>
<start> do you have time on tuesday ? <end>
<start> she turned down my offer . <end>
<start> space travel is no longer a dream . <end>
<start> i saw him run away . <end>
<start> he just loves to bully people . <end>

<start> he s very fond of reading . <end>
<start> tom refused to open the door . <end>
<start> i have no idea what that guy is thinking . <end>
<start> this is good . <end>
<start> we offered him a nice job . <end>

<start> he had no choice but to run away . <end>
<start> i m proud of you . <end>
<start> tom isn t a tourist . <end>

<start> send for a doctor at once . <end>
<start> i d like to play cards . so would i . <end>
<start> i don t know where you re from , and neither does he . <end>
<start> tom is aware of that . <end>
<start> i m really starting to hate this town . <end>
<start> i don t feel like singing now . <end>
<start> tom realized something wasn t right . <end>
<start> he was born in england , but was educated in america . <end>
<start> tom leaped out of bed . <end>
<start> tom washed his face . <end>
<start> whoever guesses the number wins . <end>
<start> we re smarter than they think . <end>

<start> stop grumbling . <end>
<start> we celebrated all night . <end>

<start> my husband is at work . <end>
<start> they can t fire you . <end>
<start> tom said he needed to ask me a few more questions . <end>
<start> tom doesn t understand what s going on . <end>
<start> do you ever have a fever ? <end>
<start> i am memorizing a text . <end>
<start> this is our last chance . <end>
<start> he is inaccessible to his employees . <end>
<start> i don t speak french well . <end>
<start> the storm caused a lot of damage . <end>
<start> i am too short . <end>
<start> it was ten degrees below zero this morning . <end>
<start> nobody listens to me . <end>
<start> have you ever read a book in chinese ? <end>
<start> tom hasn t bought bread yet . <end>
<start> this computer is yours , isn t it ? <end>
<start> i don t hear a thing . <end>
<start> would you like some chocolate ice cream ? <end>
<start> tom didn t do well enough on the driver s test to get a driver s license . <end>
<start> we re a bit busy at the moment . can you hang on a minute ? <end>
<start> what s your favorite fruit ? <end>
<start> i ll be back late tonight . <end>
<start> that disease is caused by bacteria . <end>
<start> tom sat down at one of the tables . <end>
<start> the wounded man recovered in three days . <end>
<start> can you make me a copy ? <end>
<start> tom keeps an extra pair of shoes in the trunk of his car . <end>
<start> he likes cooking for his family . <end>
<start> i can do this on my own . <end>
<start> she promised not to tell anyone . <end>
<start> not every bird can sing . <end>
<start> tom never saw mary . <end>
<start> evil sometimes wins . <end>
<start> tom is old and clumsy . <end>
<start> she can sing very well . <end>
<start> we played and laughed . <end>
<start> his ambition made him work hard . <end>
<start> it ain t over till the fat lady sings . <end>
<start> from this point , we must proceed with caution . <end>
<start> he is able to swim very fast . <end>
<start> what are you doing ? <end>
<start> you are probably wrong . <end>
<start> tom nodded . <end>
<start> he is about to leave for london . <end>
<start> i ll show you around the city . <end>
<start> the day after tomorrow is tom s birthday . <end>
<start> i don t need your protection . <end>
<start> i m quite comfortable with my decision . <end>
<start> please tell us what happened . <end>
<start> don t do this . <end>
<start> tom s hunch was right . <end>
<start> these books are ours . <end>
<start> she didn t mention the accident to me . <end>
<start> i ve got no time for that now . <end>
<start> i am not leaving you . <end>
<start> please drive slowly . <end>
<start> the knife is dull . <end>
<start> he told the truth . <end>
<start> i had a good opinion of her . <end>
<start> you want to talk , don t you ? <end>
<start> tom doesn t have much time left . <end>
<start> the company suffered a loss of one billion yen last year . <end>
<start> tom should have known better than to trust mary . <end>
<start> what was the name of the last song you sang last night ? <end>
<start> i overslept and consequently couldn t join them . <end>
<start> i m a little confused . <end>
<start> please send me a letter . <end>
<start> i want to see if tom is in town . <end>
<start> they go to church every sunday . <end>
<start> tom was afraid that they d lock him up and throw away the key . <end>
<start> i think that you re right . <end>
<start> let s dance together . i thought you d never ask . <end>
<start> i don t want visitors . <end>
<start> would you like to have tea with us this afternoon ? <end>
<start> you could see the look of scorn on tom s face . <end>
<start> tom has a ticket . <end>
<start> we got up at dawn . <end>
<start> they say he s the richest person in the city . <end>
<start> i still don t feel right . <end>
<start> i would like to eat sushi . <end>
<start> i just thought you might want to eat something . <end>
<start> i know tom is your friend . <end>
<start> shoes change one s life . just ask cinderella ! <end>
<start> tom ran barefoot in the snow . <end>
<start> how likely is that ? <end>
<start> does it work now ? <end>
<start> it is quite natural for her to get angry . <end>
<start> i didn t tell you everything . <end>
<start> there isn t much time . <end>
<start> all of us know him well . <end>
<start> it made me feel bad . <end>
<start> we had no choice except to put up with it . <end>
<start> i ll remember this incident forever . <end>
<start> why are you angry with me ? <end>
<start> when my mother was young , she was very beautiful . <end>
<start> that s exactly what i used to think . <end>
<start> we have a big dog . <end>
<start> where s the director ? <end>
<start> this house is leaning to one side . <end>
<start> fir trees are often used as christmas trees . <end>
<start> i almost missed the train . <end>
<start> he doesn t know how to swim . <end>
<start> he has a bath every morning . <end>
<start> the radio doesn t work . <end>
<start> he will be coming to see me this afternoon . <end>
<start> he buttoned up his coat before walking out the door . <end>
<start> i ve got nothing in my fridge . <end>
<start> write down each word . <end>
<start> tom was the only one who knew how to start a fire without matches . <end>
<start> that s wet . <end>
<start> i went straight to bed . <end>
<start> i will make you happy . <end>
<start> are they japanese ? <end>
<start> do you believe the witness s statement ? <end>
<start> do you speak french ? <end>
<start> don t waste your money . <end>
<start> it s an honest question . <end>
<start> no one wants to talk to tom anymore . <end>
<start> tom will always love you . <end>
<start> we need a little more time . <end>
<start> we need to band together to beat the enemy . <end>
<start> nobody wants to look for my car . <end>
<start> you need to accept your role . <end>
<start> she wore a beautiful dress . <end>
<start> come along with us . <end>
<start> i closed the door quietly so i wouldn t wake the baby up . <end>
<start> tom was mary s boyfriend before she met john . <end>
<start> tom is on pain killers . <end>
<start> tom isn t feeling well . <end>
<start> the house is haunted . <end>
<start> her eyes were red from crying . <end>
<start> there s a fine line between love and hate . <end>
<start> tom accused mary of not knowing how to love or how to accept someone s love . <end>
<start> i haven t eaten since breakfast . i m hungry . <end>
<start> tom didn t want me to touch him . <end>
<start> life is expensive . <end>
<start> tom predicted mary would win the race . <end>
<start> school will open on monday . <end>
<start> tom has to get back to work . <end>
<start> do you know why tom went to boston ? <end>
<start> you don t need to shout . <end>
<start> who would do that ? <end>
<start> how do you feel about what she said ? <end>
<start> do you like to be alone ? <end>
<start> tom told his children to quit jumping on the bed . <end>
<start> thank you for doing me this favor . <end>
<start> he quickly went out of the room . <end>
<start> what sport do you like best ? <end>
<start> to the man who only has a hammer in the toolkit , every problem looks like a nail . <end>
<start> you know tom is lying . <end>
<start> i m afraid of dogs . <end>
<start> tom seldom uses power tools . <end>
<start> a man s worth should be judged by his character rather than by his social position . <end>
<start> what time do you get up on sundays ? <end>
<start> the meeting is nearly over . <end>
<start> i m amazed at his rapid progress in english . <end>
<start> i ve seen dolphins smarter than you . <end>
<start> i ll take a glass of champagne . <end>
<start> he has the bad habit of chewing his pencil . <end>
<start> i ve come to see you . <end>
<start> we can t let tom do that . <end>
<start> tom said he didn t want to study french . <end>
<start> you fainted . <end>
<start> put the book back on the shelf . <end>
<start> i have a test today , too . <end>
<start> that knife wasn t sharp and i couldn t cut the meat with it , so i resorted to using my pocket knife . <end>
<start> i thought you were raised in l . a . <end>
<start> she told him to stop . <end>
<start> he interrupted her while she was speaking . <end>
<start> the plan did not succeed . <end>
<start> the crowd calmed down . <end>
<start> tom s mean . <end>
<start> the noise distracted him from studying . <end>
<start> everyone believes in their own potential . <end>
<start> were you at home last night ? <end>
<start> pay attention to tom . <end>
<start> tom doesn t think that mary is at home . <end>
<start> butter and cheese are made from milk . <end>
<start> i thought we would have breakfast together . <end>
<start> what were you doing at   o clock last night ? <end>
<start> don t touch that doorknob . <end>
<start> tom has a cottage by the sea . <end>
<start> they re taking the freight out of the train car . <end>
<start> i don t know my address yet , i m going to stay with my friend for a while . <end>
<start> it s bad for the heart . <end>
<start> my children are coming with me . <end>
<start> did you learn anything new today ? <end>
<start> i need to know now . <end>
